<div id="l6P2lZS-QnKsBGBVTIG0fg3845" class="class2">Epilogue</div>
<div class="class3">By Kuchiba Hatsumi’s hand, Vuishta was severed from his right collar to his left thigh, and from his left flank to his right armpit. The Hazy Cross of the Phantom Sword of the Kurikara Dharani. If he remembered correctly, it was supposed to be a phantom strike that cut from the collar to the waist, and then a physical strike that transformed into one from the waist to the collar. And Vuishta ate both of them. In other words, even if one could see the sword technique, there was a high probability of a target taking at least one of the slashes.</div>
<div class="class3">“With that, the moon hunt was completely unneeded meddling, huh?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Seriously. But there’s no doubting the fact that I was able to take him down with absolute certainty thanks to your help.”</div>
<div class="class3">Hatsumi replied as she let out a long sigh. The moonlight that revealed her sword’s movements would become like a heat haze when she used her technique—hard to discern at best. She concluded that Vuishta would be unable to read it. It was an ingenious hand for her to play, and may have been the single strike she was confident would bring about certain death. It may have been a decision she made that would bring about an end to the fight, but...</div>
<div class="class3">“If you have amnesia, how can you do that kinda thing?”</div>
<div class="class3">“I don’t want to hear it from you. Even if you were alone, you could have defeated him while laughing scornfully all the while, no?”</div>
<div class="class3">“That’s overestimating me a bit too much. I had a vanguard, so that made things easy on me. If I was on my own, it wouldn’t have gone like that.”</div>
<div class="class3">“I wonder about that. Rather, from the very beginning of the fight, frankly speaking, you were quite shady.”</div>
<div class="class3">“Occupational hazard.”</div>
<div class="class3">In response to being called shady, Suimei gave a rather gracious reply. Magicians were fundamentally suspicious people. They’d act foolish, shady, and mysterious. In that sense, they were terrible. However, Hatsumi didn’t care about any of that. She just looked at him suspiciously with half-closed eyes.</div>
<div class="class3">“If you came up in a story of heroes, then you would be the type who showed up as an ally but was actually the secret boss.”</div>
<div class="class3">“The kind that you can’t beat without getting dragged along by them, huh? Certainly, I fit the mold of the shady guy who appears perfect at first.”</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei shrugged his shoulders as he laughed, and Hatsumi gave him an exasperated smile.</div>
<div class="class3">“You sure are composed.”</div>
<div class="class3">“Well, thanks to you.”</div>
<div class="class3">Hatsumi seemed to have relaxed quite a bit. And in the midst of their frank exchange, she spoke up like she suddenly remembered something.</div>
<div class="class3">“Now that I think about it, you said something about it earlier, but you fought a man like him once?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Well... Yeah. It was a guy who used magicka in a similar way to make location of his real body ambiguous. Actually, it was too similar...”</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei’s face clouded over as he trailed off. He was remembering an unpleasant battle. One that reminded him of his own worthlessness.</div>
<div class="class3">“Hmm. Could it be that guy is also here?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Don’t be stupid. That’s impossible.”</div>
<div class="class3">“That’s what I thought about you at first. I don’t think you can outright deny it without thinking about it...”</div>
<div class="class3">“Nope, that can’t be. It really can’t.”</div>
<div class="class3">As he repeatedly denied her, Hatsumi grew a bit irritated, but she calmed down after seeing Suimei’s expression. His face as he kept saying it wasn’t possible was grim and filled with anxiety. He then looked up at the moon and said something unexpected.</div>
<div class="class3">“The Greed of Ten, Kudrack the Ghosthide. That’s the name of the man who used that magicka.”</div>
<div class="class3">It was quite some time ago Suimei had fought him. It was after Hydemary became his assistant and after he became acquainted with Isrina. He was using modern magicka, living for the ideals of the Society... And Kudrack was the man who’d betrayed all that.</div>
<div class="class3">He was a magician who killed others, and did not loathe making the mysteries known to the entire world. But because those who were released from death could not be stopped by anyone, his criminal record piled up completely unchallenged over the span of a half century. But he began planning something. Something far too nefarious. And so several organizations of magicians sent in agents to subjugate him. Suimei was one of them.</div>
<div class="class3">“I was the one who obliterated him. Even if he was a lich, he can’t exist after having his roots severed. But even if I screwed up and he survived, just who would have summoned that man here? Besides, I can’t see any reason for that man to team up with the demons. He was an extreme asshole who thought that all living creatures would find the best salvation by dying and returning to the earth, you know? That kinda asshole...”</div>
<div class="class3">There’s no way he’d survived. But just the thought of it sent goosebumps down Suimei’s skin. He wasn’t sure how Hatsumi had taken what he said, but she made a strangely convincing statement.</div>
<div class="class3">“If everything is destroyed by the demons, it may end up like that.”</div>
<div class="class3">“I’m begging you, don’t say that again... It’ll seriously turn into reality.”</div>
<div class="class3">“Was he that strong?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Only about a million times stronger than the guy we just beat up. Maybe even ten million. If we had to go up against him, it would be simpler to take on all the demons, demon generals and the Demon Lord all at once. Aaah, I feel like puking.”</div>
<div class="class3">She wasn’t sure if he was fooling around, but Suimei went pale as he slumped his shoulders. Not knowing the circumstances at all, Hatsumi spoke like it wasn’t a problem in the least.</div>
<div class="class3">“But you defeated him, right?”</div>
<div class="class3">“I did. It’s ’cause the world’s number one shittiest enemy was an ally at the time. If that wasn’t the case, I would’ve been cut into mincemeat by those phase blades.”</div>
<div class="class3">At the time, the man who was his ally for the moment was the man who’d laughed at his dreams. Then same one he’d mentioned when saving Lefille.</div>
<div class="class3">“I don’t wanna go through it a second time. If that guy is alive, before the demons could annihilate humanity, he’d do it with pleasure.”</div>
<div class="class3">Hatsumi then questioned him in a puzzled tone.</div>
<div class="class3">“Is our world... that dangerous a place?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Not at all. It’s so peaceful it’ll bore you to death.”</div>
<div class="class3">“Then why is it...?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Who knows? The reason the balance between danger and peace became so weird just shows how far into the end of days we are. I don’t know if we’re racing towards the end because we’re trying to fight it or because that’s just the natural course of things, but I really can’t laugh about the possibility of the world ending before we even make it back.”</div>
<div class="class3">“It’s not really the time to be saving another world, huh?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Even if you say that, no matter what we do, when it ends, it ends. We’re not heroes in our world. About all we can do is tremble in our houses as we count out our remaining days.”</div>
<div class="class3">After letting out a sigh like this was no laughing matter, Suimei mimicked the movements of a soldier doing a complete about face accurately and turned towards the ruins.</div>
<div class="class3">“Well, setting that aside, I’m going to go ahead and continue my investigation.”</div>
<div class="class3">Putting all of his concerns aside for the time, he seemed completely refreshed. Suimei happily walked back over to the remains of the stones where the magicka circle was drawn. Hatsumi followed after him with light steps. But before she reached him she stopped in her tracks. She sensed something terrible.</div>
<div class="class3">“Hey, Yakagi...”</div>
<div class="class3">“So it isn’t over yet?”</div>
<div class="class3">As if replying to Hatsumi’s warning, Suimei sighed like it was getting tedious. Just how much more was he supposed to put off his investigation? That presence that was wriggling about within the darkness of the forest was, without a doubt, the remnants of the demons.</div>
<div class="class3">The two of them faced the direction the demons would likely be coming from and waited. Between the darkwood trees in front of them, they could see the darkness opening up. Anticipating that they would be the point of attack, Hatsumi shouldered her sword and Suimei prepared his magicka.</div>
<div class="class3">Before long, the demons showed themselves. In the darkness, one figure followed another in a long line. They didn’t quite number as much as they did when they were surrounded earlier, but they were in position to charge in all at once and were brimming with bloodlust.</div>
<div class="class3">“It’ll be a series of battles. You think you can manage?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Don’t be stupid. I won’t lose to some small fries.”</div>
<div class="class3">Though he spoke in a lighthearted manner, Suimei was not smiling. Even though she didn’t think that Suimei’s manner of speaking was haughty, he looked deadly serious. But in the moment it came down to attack or be attacked, a shadow suddenly fell down from directly above the demons.</div>
<div class="class3">They didn’t have any time to wonder what had just appeared. Only Hatsumi’s puzzled gasp rang out in the clearing, for the demons had been struck down in an instant from above by a shockwave. They, along with the ground and trees, were blown away.</div>
<div class="class3">A few trailing at the very end of the line remained, but they were some distance from Suimei and Hatsumi. Riding the shockwave, huge rocks and splinters of trees were sailing at them.</div>
<div class="class3">“Wh-What is this?”</div>
<div class="class3">“...”</div>
<div class="class3">While gripped by confusion, Hatsumi held her sword forward while Suimei used magicka to repel the debris that was flying towards them at a murderous speed. As the thunderous roar settled, a man with silver horns growing out of his head, wearing clothing similar to traditional Japanese attire appeared. With his fist planted in the ground in the center of the dead demons, he announced himself with a complaint.</div>
<div class="class3">“How fragile. To think these pests worse than shit could threaten all that live under the Goddess. I don’t know who said it, but it’s such a bad joke it sends shivers running down my spine.”</div>
<div class="class3">It was almost like he was talking to himself. Perhaps he was only spitting at the demons at his feet. Eventually, the other demons noticed the unexpected visitor, and lunged at the man with their horns from the sides. However, he brushed them away with the back of his fist, and the demons were smashed up along with the darkwood trees they flew into.</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei and Hatsumi were at a loss for words at this overwhelming display of power.</div>
<div class="class3">It was fine that he was blowing away the demons. It wasn’t like they couldn’t have done it themselves, however. But this man moved like he was just swatting away a fly. It was incomprehensible that even the sturdy darkwood trees could be smashed to pieces like that. The man shook his hand like he had just touched something dirty, and suddenly, his gaze was fixed on Suimei.</div>
<div class="class3">“...Ugh!”</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei’s heart leaped with a single strong thud. His body was seized with fear. It was because he’d seen such overwhelming strength. No, it wasn’t the man’s strength. It was his mere existence. His very gaze. Unexpectedly, one of Suimei’s feet took a step back in retreat. He was moving on sheer instinct.</div>
<div class="class3">Ever since coming to this world, Suimei hadn’t experienced anything like this. On the other hand, Hatsumi remained unaware of the crisis that was approaching them. Perhaps she judged that an ally had appeared. She was only looking at the man with silver horns in wonder.</div>
<div class="class3">“The hero and... Oh? Are you one of her companions?”</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei was unable to answer his question. Alarm bells were clanging nonstop inside his head. Other than the internal screams telling him to run away, he could barely hear anything. Meanwhile, Hatsumi stepped forward to answer him.</div>
<div class="class3">“Just who are you? Why do you know that I’m here? An ally?”</div>
<div class="class3">“I wonder. That depends on you.”</div>
<div class="class3">“What do you mean?”</div>
<div class="class3">Those intentionally perplexing words, Hatsumi’s puzzled voice... Suimei heard none of it. Then it finally set in on him just what he was standing before.</div>
<div class="class3">“Are you... a dragon?”</div>
<div class="class3">Perhaps because Suimei’s trembling question was on the mark, the man’s mouth warped into a smile. Sensing the change that had come over Suimei, Hatsumi gave him a quizzical look.</div>
<div class="class3">“Yakagi...?”</div>
<div class="class3">“As I thought...”</div>
<div class="class3">“Bastard, you seem quite frightened. I can’t approve of a man who can’t at least bluff before his enemy.”</div>
<div class="class3">“Sh-Shut up! This is a normal reaction!”</div>
<div class="class3">“However, I don’t have any business with a scared weakling. Sorry, but I’ll have you vanish.”</div>
<div class="class3">As if concluding that Suimei was boring, the man pierced him with a cold gaze. And then he slightly opened his mouth, and began sucking in air.</div>
<div class="class3">A dragon’s roar.</div>
<div class="class3">The moment Suimei sensed it, the tension that was binding his body and the trembling that shook him vanished. The only thing occupying his mind was evading the menace before him. Hatsumi had no clue what was about to happen, and stepped forward with her sword at the ready as if to protect him. And Suimei strongly grabbed her shoulder.</div>
<div class="class3">“Hatsumi! Come here!”</div>
<div class="class3">“Huh?”</div>
<div class="class3">“Behind me! Quickly! You’ll get swallowed by the dragon’s roar!”</div>
<div class="class3">“Dragon’s r... Kyah?!”</div>
<div class="class3">Suimei pulled the bewildered Hatsumi behind him forcefully, and thrust both his hands forwards as he began chanting.</div>
<div class="class3">“Mea aegis non est aegis. Prae omni oppugnatione est solida. Prae omni impetu est invicta. Invincibilis, immobilis, immortalis. Id est ardens aureum castrum ut colligit spiritus astorum. Eius nomen est—”</div>
<div class="class5">[My shield is not a shield. It is sturdy before any and all offense. It is unshakable before any and all attacks. Invincible, immobile, imperishable. It is the shining golden castle which collects the breath of the stars. Its name is—]</div>
<div class="class3">Along with the mana Suimei was letting out, many golden magicka circles were deploying around the two of them. The magicka circles to the front were revolving, the large magicka circle at their feet had a needle etched in which was counting the seconds like a clock. As Suimei’s six-verse chant came to an end, all of the magicka circles stabilized.</div>
<div class="class3">“Mea firma aegis! Speciosum aureum magnale!”</div>
<div class="class5">[My firm shield! The brilliant golden fortress!]</div>
<div class="class3">As Suimei let out his keyword, the man with horns released a high pitched grating sound from his mouth which shook the air. Just as the wave of oscillations spread into their surroundings, the ground was astir like it was boiling, and fissures resembling red lightning were flickering in the air. The air was electrified as the molecules were agitated. Within that illusion of the world being thrown into a bright red plasma ball, everything was transformed into a red hot mass.</div>
<div class="class3">Between the flickering flashes, everything in their vision was dyed red, and eventually the earth, the darkwood trees, the corpses of the demons, the summoning ruins, anything and everything was equally swallowed up in an explosion.</div>
<div class="class3">That thunderous roar and the whirlwind of incandescence could be mistaken for a small scale solar flare. The still night had fallen into a burning hell. If the dust explosion Suimei created could be described as dynamite, this was more like a nuclear explosion.</div>
<div class="class3">Eventually, the flames settled down, and the scenery around them completely changed.</div>
<div class="class3">“This... is...”</div>
<div class="class3">Hatsumi was gazing around in wonderment. She wasn’t even able to grasp what had just happened. The darkwood trees and the ruins were completely blown away together with the ashes. All that remained was the upturned dirt on the ground and a slew of burning embers.</div>
<div class="class3">On the other hand, the man with horns, for some reason, opened his mouth wide completely unexpectedly. For a while, he only looked at Suimei in a complete daze. As Suimei wondered what he was up to, the man with horns suddenly began laughing like a fire had been ignited in him.</div>
<div class="class3">“Pfft, AHAHAHAHAHA! Ha... to think you would endure that head on! I always thought it was something that a mere human could never defend against, but my goodness, what a fool I was! Bravo! Bravo!”</div>
<div class="class3">He certainly sounded happy. After laughing for a while, he gazed at Suimei fanatically. In spite of focusing entirely on the hero before, he didn’t spare her even a glance now. He was only staring at Suimei like he was scrutinizing a sword of the finest quality. And then...</div>
<div class="class3">“Man in black. Bastard— No, I take back calling you a weakling. Calling a man who steps forward to protect a woman a weakling, whatever the case may be, is simply not the truth. Besides, you endured that without a single scratch too, the reason for your trembling was not simple fear was it?”</div>
<div class="class3">This time, the man smiled as he bared his fangs. It was just like a starving beast who had finally found its prey—a terrifying and ferocious smile. Just his joy from anticipating that meal conjured Suimei’s fear again. Now that he was once more reduced to quivering, Hatsumi questioned the man again.</div>
<div class="class3">“You’re...”</div>
<div class="class3">“Hmm? Ooh! That’s right. I completely forgot. My goodness, to think I have a duty to perform after finding such a superb trophy. The whims of the world are truly something. However—”</div>
<div class="class3">He was speaking as if he just remembered what he was doing. No, that man seriously may have completely forgotten about Hatsumi.</div>
<div class="class3">“I am the dragonnewt Eanru. Hero of the Alliance, Hatsumi, regardless of whether you consent or not, I will have you come with me this evening.”</div>
<div class="class3">Eanru flashed his draconic fangs in the moonlight.</div>
