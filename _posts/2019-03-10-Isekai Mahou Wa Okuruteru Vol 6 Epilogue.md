      <h1>Epilogue I</h1>

      <p>Elliot Austin had just arrived in the western territory of the kingdom of Astel—in Kurant City, to be precise. While visiting the area at the request of the Church of Salvation, he was also en route to the country of Thoria, which lay to the north of Astel. But right here and now in Kurant City, he stood before a towering mansion under the evening sky. In the light of the mana lamps placed outside, he once more looked at the letter that had been passed to him that afternoon.</p>

      <p>“My goodness. I get an invitation as soon as I arrive...”</p>

      <p>He let out a long sigh, reflecting on how hectic it was to be a hero. Promptly after he arrived, as though he was expected, he’d received an invitation from the lord of the mansion in front of him.</p>

      <p>That lord was Lucas de Hadorious, the ruler of Kurant City and an important noble who held great influence in Astel. Elliot had a formal meeting with him set up by the Church of Salvation for the next day, but preempting that, Hadorious had set up a meeting of his own. Elliot had no reason to refuse, so after leaving Christa behind at their lodgings at the church, he’d come to visit the mansion.</p>

      <p>Upon introducing himself to the gate guards and flashing the letter he’d received, Elliot was immediately shown inside. As he passed through the door to the private room where Hadorious was seated, he took a moment to appreciate how dimly lit it was. The only thing serving as a light source was the moonlight coming in from the window. The man who’d summoned him was sitting at his desk, exuding a needless intensity from his eyes without so much as saying a word. It was overwhelming, even compared to the aura Graziella gave off.</p>

      <p>Elliot was quite taken aback by it, but trying to make sure that it didn’t show on the surface, he stepped forward and stood before the duke. He was definitely pressuring Elliot, but Hadorious simply pretended like he didn’t realize that and called out to Elliot.</p>

      <p>“The hero of El Meide, Elliot-dono... I thank you for accepting my sudden summons. How are you doing this evening?”</p>

      <p>“Up until now everything was just normal, but after coming to your estate, I feel like I’m suddenly between a rock and a hard place.”</p>

      <p>“I’m sure you do.”</p>

      <p>Hearing Elliot’s sarcastic tone, Hadorious responded with a snort. This man seemed to keep his wariness concealed.</p>

      <p><em>As I thought, this man is aware...</em></p>

      <p>Unlike the emperor of Nelferia who always and without exception had an intimidating air about him, Hadorious’s intensity seemed to be used with a sense of purpose. It was like his stone gaze was some sort of test, and it went without question that the one being tested would surely feel the pressure. While Elliot was nursing such doubts, he kept up his facade and questioned Hadorious.</p>

      <p>“Are you not going to turn on the lights?”</p>

      <p>“I simply thought it would be more refined to sit under the moonlight. If you do not mind, then I would like to leave it as such.”</p>

      <p>Elliot internally questioned Hadorious’s mysterious subtleties, but outwardly gave a nod in response.</p>

      <p>“And so, what business do you have with me today?”</p>

      <p>“As the lord of this town, I thought it was necessary to greet you.”</p>

      <p>“If it was a greeting you were after, you could have waited until tomorrow. Besides, calling this a greeting is pure pretense at this point.”</p>

      <p>“Regarding that, I recall Astel’s hero saying something similar.”</p>

      <p>There, a faint smile surfaced on Hadorious’s lips. Seeing this, Elliot let just a fraction of his displeasure show as he continued.</p>

      <p>“If that is all you have to say, then I will take my leave.”</p>

      <p>“Now, now, don’t be so hasty. I have one more matter to discuss with you. The reason I called you here today, bastard, was because I wanted to have a talk with you one on one.”</p>

      <p>“Bast— Just what is it?”</p>

      <p>Elliot choked back his complaint at the sudden discourtesy and instead urged the conversation forward. Hadorious then folded his hands together atop his desk.</p>

      <p>“I’d like to hear your damned opinion on something.”</p>

      <p>“My opinion? My opinion on what, exactly? Could it be that you think I’m going to cause some kind of harm to this country?”</p>

      <p>“No, I believe no such thing. You see, I simply want to know why it is you wish to save this world.”</p>

      <p>To Elliot, this seemed like nothing more than foolish, pompous whimsy—the kind typical of nobles. He was speaking like he was toying with Elliot, but regardless, Elliot replied honestly.</p>

      <p>“It is not like I want to save the world itself, per se. I am simply saving the people who wish to be saved, and as a result, the world is also being saved. It is not something that I give much thought.”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>“Does that answer not please you?”</p>

      <p>To Hadorious, it must have sounded unconvincing. As Elliot was thinking that, Hadorious shook his head.</p>

      <p>“Let me rephrase: why do you want to defeat the demons, bastard?”</p>

      <p>“...Just as I said before, to save the people who want to be saved.”</p>

      <p>“I see. That is quite noble of you.”</p>

      <p>“As I suspected, this answer does not satisfy you, does it?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, it is strange.”</p>

      <p>Faced with the continuous stream of indirect replies mixed with sarcasm, Elliot’s tone was starting to betray his irritation.</p>

      <p>“I believe that standing up to fight for the sake of others is only natural.”</p>

      <p>“However, it does not have anything to do with you personally, does it? The crisis of this world, the people here... You’re an unrelated third party.”</p>

      <p>“That is certainly true, but...”</p>

      <p>He had a point there, but Elliot had his pride. In his world, he was a brave and well-known warrior. He had built up his own sense of pride and established his own set of values. He would never act only to benefit his own well-being. It was true he wasn’t from this world, but he’d become personally invested in it and its people. He couldn’t just bluntly refuse them. It seemed that Hadorious had also picked up on his train of thought...</p>

      <p>“So how does this all necessitate defeating the demons? Even without fighting them, can’t you still save the people of this world?”</p>

      <p>“I am fighting the demons because it was requested of me, and I have the power to do so. That is why I complied.”</p>

      <p>“I see. You are the same as the others in that regard, then.”</p>

      <p>“...?”</p>

      <p>Elliot was unable to grasp Hadorious’s true motives behind his mysterious phrasing, and was racking his brain for a suitable reply.</p>

      <p>“You have a better understanding than that man, it must be said. At least in regards as to how the world actually works.”</p>

      <p>“...?”</p>

      <p>“Based on your reply to my earlier question, I will ask you one more. You have resolved yourself to fight the demons, but why do you really think that is? To come to this world and act as a hero to save it... Do you not find it strange that you never once doubted what you were doing?”</p>

      <p>“Whether I found it strange or not, my will to fight was nothing other than my own.”</p>

      <p>Fighting the demons was something he had decided to do himself. Certainly, the fact that his motivation seemed bottomless was odd, even to Elliot himself, but...</p>

      <p>“That is not what I meant, bastard. You are— No, it’s not just you. Every single one of you heroes are being manipulated.”</p>

      <p>“Manipulated? By who?”</p>

      <p>“The Goddess. The fact that you have all decided to fight with such conviction in this world is no coincidence. It was all influenced by the Goddess and her plans.”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>Hearing Hadorious’s bold declaration, Elliot kept his mouth shut and thought it over. Just where exactly was he going with this? He’d started asking about why Elliot was fighting, and had now moved on to the Goddess... Elliot couldn’t see the end goal of this conversation. To him, it all seemed like some kind of joke. But for some reason, he was unable to just laugh it off.</p>

      <p>“And why does that matter to you? We heroes received divine protection from the Goddess, so surely it’s reasonable to assume that there could be some other kind of intervention involved. Besides, I do not think it’s a particularly bad thing in this case if it’s for the sake of saving people.”</p>

      <p>“It is just as you say, bastard. However, what if it wasn’t actually for the sake of the people? If the heroes’ existence was only to satisfy the Goddess’s selfish desires, what would you think about it then?”</p>

      <p>“Let me riddle you this. Because the nature of divinity is so vast and out of our realm of understanding, it is foolish to assume that gods possess the same mundane motivations that humans do. I do not believe that anything truly divine is capable of greed.”</p>

      <p>So he declared. But as Elliot spoke, beads of sweat began forming on his forehead. He’d realized something that he didn’t want to, and it was immediately beginning to weigh on him. The pressure of it, much like Hadorious’s gaze, was relentless.</p>

      <p>“If you’re so knowledgeable about the beings known as gods, then you should have also already thought about this. Certainly, gods do not possess a sense of greed. But just what are these so-called gods, really? What exactly do they do?”</p>

      <p>As Elliot gulped hard, he contemplated Hadorious’s questions, and in doing so, recalled a conversation he’d previously had with Suimei. The talk he was currently having with Hadorious wasn’t too different. Suimei too had asked him his opinion on the gods, but because Elliot mistook him for a person of this world, he hadn’t investigated it any further. If he had, he likely would have arrived at the conclusion he was just about to...</p>

      <p>“Well, Elliot-dono?”</p>

      <p>“...For the sake of amassing their own power, they are existences that exert their authority.”</p>

      <p>“And do you think that such existences would allow individuals that they’ve invested their power in to act freely? You know deep in your heart that you are dancing to the Goddess’s tune, correct?”</p>

      <p>He was right. Elliot’s actions may not have truly been his own will. It was reasonable to wonder if the reason he so thoroughly believed that he had to fight the demons no matter what was truly because something was working behind the scenes to plant that suggestion in his head.</p>

      <p>“But... is that wrong?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm?”</p>

      <p>“Certainly, it may not be my own will. Our fight may be the result of the Goddess’s despotism. However, because of that, people will be saved. In that case, I do not think it is particularly a bad thing. You could even say it’s necessary. After all, it is the will of the gods.”</p>

      <p>“To say you’re simply doing what’s necessary is to deny your own agency in your destiny. Fragile lives are lost or trampled every day because of ‘the will of the gods.’ Would you still say that’s necessary, bastard?”</p>

      <p>“What are you referring to?”</p>

      <p>But when Elliot asked that, Hadorious answered his question with another question.</p>

      <p>“Allow me to ask you this first: What kind of place was your world? Was it a world where people strived to make life better? Aren’t those efforts the foundation upon which your world was built?”</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? Isn’t that obvi—”</p>

      <p>Indeed, to Elliot, it was obvious that people always strove for a better life. As long as people lived, they would push for development and the betterment of themselves and society. However, from the way Hadorious was speaking, it sounded like he was skeptical of something...</p>

      <p>It was then that Elliot realized it. Hadorious’s questions had made him realize the mechanism that drove this world.</p>

      <p>“It couldn’t be... This world...”</p>

      <p>The moment he asked for confirmation, the door to the office opened and several soldiers appeared. As they fell into line, Elliot glanced at them and questioned Hadorious.</p>

      <p>“What is the meaning of this?”</p>

      <p>“Our conversation is over for now. I’ll be moving on to testing you.”</p>

      <p>“If it is something violent, then I will lodge a complaint with the Church of Salvation.”</p>

      <p>“That’ll only be if you manage to leave here, no?”</p>

      <p>“Do you really think they’ll be able to stop me?”</p>

      <p>Hadorious’s words were arrogant and daring, but the only forces he’d summoned were mere soldiers. Even if they attacked together, they would be no match for Elliot who was under the Goddess’s divine protection. But as Elliot was thinking this, Hadorious stood up from his desk.</p>

      <p>“I’ll be your opponent, bastard.”</p>

      <p>“For the esteemed duke to step forward himself... Will it not be troublesome if you’re injured fighting a hero?”</p>

      <p>“First, let’s see you try.”</p>

      <p>Ignoring Elliot’s sarcasm, Hadorious provoked him. It was difficult to have a spat within a lord’s manor, but judging that nothing would be accomplished through diplomacy now, Elliot drew his sword and attacked. But he was stopped in his tracks by Hadorious’s sword before he realized that he’d even drawn it.</p>

      <p>“Wha?!”</p>

      <p>“Hah... As I thought, you jump to action differently from the others.”</p>

      <p>“You stopped my sword... with one hand?”</p>

      <p>Elliot had no intention of actually hitting Hadorious. He fully planned on stopping just shy of striking him to make a point. The speed of his sword was such that no human should have been able to see it coming, so it was a tremendous shock that Hadorious had been able to block it—wielding his blade single-handedly, no less.</p>

      <p>“Hero, surely you do not intend to say that this is all you’ve got... You also held back when you fought the third imperial princess of the Empire, did you not?”</p>

      <p>“...How do you know that?”</p>

      <p>“Let’s just say I have my ways of finding things out.”</p>

      <p>Elliot put his strength into his sword, but the resistance he felt made him leap backward. He then returned his sword to its sheath.</p>

      <p>He couldn’t understand this man. He had no idea what he was thinking. At this rate, anything could happen. He could be captured, even killed... Nothing seemed impossible at this point.</p>

      <p>Coming to that conclusion, Elliot made his resolve. What he needed to do right now was to use all his strength to make an escape. Still unarmed, Elliot rolled up his right sleeve. When he did, a silver gauntlet appeared on his forearm. He then gave his final warning.</p>

      <p>“...If I get serious, it will come at no small material cost to this mansion, you understand.”</p>

      <p>“That is only if you are able to use your power well.”</p>

      <p>“Allow me to show you just what I can do.”</p>

      <p>Electricity coiled around Elliot’s arm. It lashed out, smashing and destroying the furnishings it touched. But even so, he was still holding it back. And it seemed Hadorious saw through even that.</p>

      <p>“A great power, I see... This is why you could not use it in the middle of the city.”</p>

      <p>“Naturally. Because of the divine protection from the hero summoning, my power is exceptionally strong. If I used this in the middle of a city, it would be a bother to innocent civilians.”</p>

      <p>Just as Elliot was about to throw himself at Hadorious...</p>

      <p>“If you have that much power, then it is more than enough.”</p>

      <p>“More than enough...?”</p>

      <p>“I am talking about the divine protection. If it is that well adapted to your body, then the necessary portion has likely been filled.”</p>

      <p>“I do not know what you are talking about, but I am not about to stand down at this point.”</p>

      <p>“Do as you please. After all, it is not my role to stop you.”</p>

      <p>Immediately after Hadorious’s veiled threat, a shock ran through Elliot’s nape.</p>

      <p>“Wh... What...?”</p>

      <p>Elliot was puzzled. The sudden blow left his consciousness hazy, and he used all his strength to focus on his senses. The soldiers behind him had showed no signs of moving, but...</p>

      <p>“As one would expect of the Lonely Shadow. To think even this hero was unable to sense you. Your title isn’t just for show, I see.”</p>

      <p>A name he had heard before reached Elliot’s ears. When he was in the Empire, the people from the army spoke fearfully of the Lonely Shadow, a man with swept-back black hair accentuated with a splash of gray. He had reddish-brown eyes and a rigid face. His presence could meld into any shadow. He was the Empire’s greatest swordsman and assassin.</p>

      <p>“R-Rogue Zandyke... Just when...”</p>

      <p>“From the very beginning. It was wise to take note of the soldiers who came in, but to neglect the possibility that someone was lurking here from the start... It’s a mistake one would expect a hero to make.”</p>

      <p>“Ugh...”</p>

      <p>Unable to support his body anymore, Elliot fell to a knee while trembling. While vaguely listening to Rogue’s warning, Elliot’s consciousness gradually sank into a muddy darkness. After Rogue confirmed that he was out cold, he carried Elliot over to the sofa and laid him down. He then turned to Hadorious.</p>

      <p>“...Could you not have done it yourself?”</p>

      <p>“It was better for you to. The hero’s power is not something that can be underestimated.”</p>

      <p>“And who was the one who took that power head-on?” Rogue replied in a taciturn manner.</p>

      <p>His attitude was insolent, but it seemed there was something of an understanding between him and Hadorious. The soldiers in the room certainly said nothing of it. After a moment’s pause, Hadorious raised a different matter.</p>

      <p>“However, was that alright? Becoming a Universal Apostle like us?”</p>

      <p>“A foolish question. I have sworn my sword to Gottfried-dono. Isn’t the same true for you?”</p>

      <p>“No.”</p>

      <p>“Explain.”</p>

      <p>“My sword is already dedicated to another. I cannot lie about that. Of course, I have not forgotten my great admiration for that man.”</p>

      <p>Hadorious was clearly thinking of someone. Rogue felt like he could nearly see a hallucination in the direction his far-off gaze was staring.</p>

      <p>“Hadorious-dono, there is one thing that I must pass on to you.”</p>

      <p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>

      <p>“The demons have moved. They’ve already plunged into Thoria and are on their way to the Empire.”</p>

      <p>“I see. As expected, they moved precisely as he predicted.”</p>

      <p>As Hadorious sighed, Rogue raised a doubt of his own. Something that had been bothering him.</p>

      <p>“Isn’t this different from the original plan? The invasion of the demons in Astel and the departure of Reiji-dono to the self-governed state. The failure to capture the Alliance’s hero. There have been deviations that cannot be ignored.”</p>

      <p>“Regarding that, adjustments are being made on each occasion. As such, there’s no real problem. The original plan was to gather all of the heroes beforehand, but it seems that has changed a little.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean? In that case, the Empire will have to stand and fight against the demons without a hero and end up losing, right?”</p>

      <p>“No, that will not happen.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm... Then the Alliance’s hero will go to the Empire? Or will we have this hero take care of the demon subjugation ahead of schedule?”</p>

      <p>Rogue gave Elliot a sidelong glance, but Hadorious shook his head.</p>

      <p>“No, that duty will fall on Astel’s hero.”</p>

      <p>“But are Reiji-dono’s abilities not insufficient? A fight against an army of demons would likely be too heavy a responsibility for him. After the incident in the Empire, its prominent nobles have decreased in number. If it’s not Elliot-dono, then I don’t think things will balance back out properly.”</p>

      <p>“Regarding the hero of Astel’s abilities, it is not a matter to be concerned over. We will simply play our hand so that he can win. Besides, Hero Reiji is currently quite famous. Because he was made out as the one who defeated ten thousand demons in Astel, his reputation exceeds Hero Elliot’s.”</p>

      <p>“But the Alliance’s hero has also defeated a demon general, correct?”</p>

      <p>“The Alliance’s Hero Hatsumi has just ended a large battle with the demons in a draw. She was also unable to quell the uproar in Miazen. That will affect her reputation. Meanwhile, Hero Reiji has inherited a legendary weapon from the self-governed state and driven back the demon general who attacked him for it. If he drives back the demons from the Empire on top of that...”</p>

      <p>“Certainly, Reiji-dono would be known as the strongest hero.”</p>

      <p>Currently, Reiji’s apparent achievements as a hero had indeed surpassed Elliot’s. In terms of actual ability, he was somewhat lacking, but to the people who blindly believed in the tales of heroes, none of that mattered. Seeing that Rogue was convinced, Hadorious glanced over at Elliot.</p>

      <p>“All that matters is the faith of the populace. Certainly, it is also important for a hero to have the power to drive back the demons, but that is a secondary concern. Currently, the Alliance’s hero is the strongest of all, but the divine protection she received is inferior. However, since Hero Reiji has been steadily distinguishing himself, the Goddess must also have her eye on him. Naturally, we must put the other heroes to use as well.”</p>

      <p>Pausing for a moment there, Hadorious looked up at the moon through the window.</p>

      <p>“Let us make sure that Hero Reiji gains the utmost fame that he can so that he receives the Goddess’s favor and becomes a peerless hero.”</p>

      <p>To set him up in such a high position, hardship would be completely unavoidable. After all, if he could not prove himself, it would only come back to bite him once he was elevated. Rogue muttered lightly to himself out of pity for Reiji.</p>

      <h1>Epilogue II</h1>

      <p>After Suimei’s party returned to the Nelferian Empire from the Saadias Alliance, they headed back to the house they used as a base. It was just as they’d left it. The alabaster that Suimei had heavily plastered on the walls of the surrounding buildings was still a nice, pure white. The characteristic dankness of such backstreet neighborhoods was nowhere to be found in this place, which radiated an aura of cheer and brightness. With the sunlight shining down into it from overhead, it was almost like a park.</p>

      <p>Looking around, several of the cats that Suimei had made his temporary familiars were settled on top of the tables and chairs that had been left in the patio area. They were purring and relaxing as they lay spread out. Some were lazily scratching themselves, some were snoozing away, and some were sunning themselves up on the balcony.</p>

      <p>“Kitties!”</p>

      <p>The moment she saw all this, Liliana cast aside her parasol and made a beeline for the felines, her reddish-violet twintails bouncing through the air after her. Since she’d been away for a while, she needed a refresher session of quality time with some small, furry friends. Thinking back on it, Suimei remembered that Liliana had been somewhat reluctant to part with the cats when they left the Empire.</p>

      <p>“Hug...”</p>

      <p>“Meeeow!”</p>

      <p>After capturing several cats, Liliana pressed them against her cheeks all at once. Because Liliana had made friends with them back when they were temporary familiars of Suimei’s, they didn’t at all seem to mind her affection. The only one who seemed to think anything of it was the tiny Lefille. Stooping over to grab the parasol that Liliana had cast aside, Lefille scooped up a cat herself and began talking to it.</p>

      <p>“I guess you guys aren’t going to return to where you came from, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Meow.”</p>

      <p>Even as she continued to poke the cat’s cheek and question it, the only reply she received—of course—was meowing. She’d known that would happen, but still felt like she had to try. It was Liliana, who was next to her while gently petting as many cats as she could, that replied for them.</p>

      <p>“It’s pretty here... and it’s easy to take an afternoon catnap... so they come around once in a while.”</p>

      <p>“Cats love clean places, after all. So I suppose in their roaming around, they enjoy stopping by here to nap and relax.”</p>

      <p>“Meow.”</p>

      <p>The cats meowed as if to agree, and Liliana listened to them intently. It looked like she was having a conversation with them, but it was just a method Suimei had taught her to come to a mutual understanding with animals.</p>

      <p>After the incident in the Empire had been resolved, the cats’ job was fulfilled. So in accordance with their contract (which had been cooperation in exchange for food and a place to sleep for a finite period of time), the magicka that partially enhanced their intelligence was dispelled. That returned them to being normal cats, and they all returned to their regular haunts. But there was no erasing the knowledge they’d gained of this place—which was indeed a wonderful place to take a catnap—so many of them returned quite frequently.</p>

      <p>“At this rate, it’ll become a gathering spot for them at night, huh?”</p>

      <p>“I imagine so, Suimei-dono. It is often said that cats like to gather.”</p>

      <p>Felmenia seemed quite happy about it. She was also rather fond of cats, so the tranquil sight of so many of them together was like food for the soul.</p>

      <p>“B-By the way, um...”</p>

      <p>Felmenia then glanced back and forth between the cats and Suimei. She’d gone from seeming cheerful to embarrassed as she fidgeted restlessly.</p>

      <p>“Hmm? Ah, the cats, right? Go on.”</p>

      <p>“Yes!”</p>

      <p>Her silver hair streaking behind her, Felmenia practically leaped towards Liliana and began petting the cats as well. Time passed like that peacefully for a while, but then Suimei and the others heard a familiar voice from down the alley.</p>

      <p>“Ah, they’re here!”</p>

      <p>It was a young man’s voice—one Suimei knew particularly well, and one that was somewhat reassuring to hear. When Suimei turned around, he spied Reiji and his party, who should have been in the Saadias Alliance. Titania then called out to him with her usual composed expression.</p>

      <p>“So you’ve returned?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, we just got back.”</p>

      <p>As Suimei shrugged his shoulders, Felmenia came running up from behind him carrying a cat. She immediately fell to one knee and properly greeted Titania like a princess.</p>

      <p>“Your Highness, it is wonderful to see you in good health.”</p>

      <p>“White Flame-dono, it is also nice to see you in such good spirits. Do you like cats?”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Um, well... yes...”</p>

      <p>The sight of Felmenia courteously kneeling with a cat in her arms was too much for even the self-possessed Titania, who began giggling. After Felmenia replied in an embarrassed tone, she moved the conversation onward.</p>

      <p>“Your Highness, if I remember correctly, was it not your plan to reassure the citizens of the self-governed state?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, we have just returned to the Empire this morning.”</p>

      <p>“Actually, we got called back by that noble again,” Reiji announced, admitting the real reason for their return.</p>

      <p>“That noble again, huh?”</p>

      <p>“Mm...”</p>

      <p>As Reiji replied with a grim expression, Suimei realized that the person in their group who was usually the loudest hadn’t made an appearance yet.</p>

      <p>“So, where’s Mizuki? I haven’t seen her yet.”</p>

      <p>“U-Um, Mizuki is...”</p>

      <p>“What’s up?”</p>

      <p>Suimei cocked his head to the side as he asked for the details, but Reiji awkwardly looked away. And just as he did...</p>

      <p>“FUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>

      <p>Suddenly, an excessively tense, high-energy laugh rang out from behind Reiji and the others. Hearing it, Suimei’s heart sank.</p>

      <p>“Say, Reiji... Why is it I’m getting such a terrible feeling about that laugh?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t make me say it...”</p>

      <p>As Reiji answered him in a tired voice, Mizuki arrived on the scene—her odd eye shining gold.</p>

      <p>“It has been a while, Dark Crimson Hider whose darkness is deeper than that of the universe I inhabit! Oh, my eternal rival!”</p>

      <p>“Ahhh... I see.”</p>

      <p>Just hearing what Mizuki said, Suimei seemed to figure out what was going on. Looking at Reiji and Titania, he could tell that the two of them were at their wits’ end. As Mizuki strode over to him confidently, Suimei beheld her with a complex expression.</p>

      <p>“You know, Mizuki... didn’t you stop doing that?”</p>

      <p>“What are you talking about? Besides, I am not Mizuki. I am a unique existence between all heaven and earth, the Holy King of the Heavens, Io Kuzami.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah... None of that’s real.”</p>

      <p>As Suimei gave an apathetic response, Felmenia looked at him bemusedly.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono, just what is even going on here? I am having a hard time understanding.”</p>

      <p>“Even if you ask me... Hey, Reiji, what’s up with this?”</p>

      <p>Reiji then explained what had happened in the self-governed state. About how they’d attained the weapon left behind by a hero of old. About how a demon general had appeared. And about how Mizuki had ended up like this.</p>

      <p>“I see... So she started acting like this after getting that weapon.”</p>

      <p>“Mm. That’s why it’s my fault. If I’d properly protected her, then...”</p>

      <p>Reiji’s expression was tense. He’d said he’d protect Mizuki from the very beginning, even before they’d left Astel. That things had turned out like this weighed heavily on him.</p>

      <p>“Well, don’t worry about it.”</p>

      <p>“But—”</p>

      <p>“Mizuki’s also responsible for saying she would go along. Besides, nothing will come out of brooding over it now. Spilled milk and all that. Also, if she suddenly got weird again, isn’t it possible she might just suddenly go back to being normal?”</p>

      <p>His burden perhaps allayed by such optimistic words, Reiji’s expression lightened.</p>

      <p>“You’re right.”</p>

      <p>“Though I have to say, I’m pretty floored by this turn of events...”</p>

      <p>“Yeah...”</p>

      <p>Reiji looked at Mizuki for a moment with a complicated expression. He likely wanted to say that he wished this hadn’t happened. And he wasn’t the only one in his group who felt that way.</p>

      <p>“Well, whatever. Let’s head inside for now. We actually just got back ourselves though, so I don’t have much to offer you in the way of hospitality.”</p>

      <p>“You needn’t pay us any mind. We’re primarily here to exchange information, after all.”</p>

      <p>Following up on Titania’s polite reply, Io Kuzami—previously known as Mizuki—took a haughty attitude.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. Then let us go to your damned castle.”</p>

      <p>“Mizuki, you wait out here for a bit.”</p>

      <p>“I am Io Kuzami.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, yeah, I got it, Io Kuzami-san. Menia, get Lefi and Liliana and go inside with Reiji and the others.”</p>

      <p>After waiting for everyone else to enter the house, Suimei turned to Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“Now then... Well, so? You’re seriously not pretending here, right?”</p>

      <p>“Do you still not believe me, bastard?”</p>

      <p>“Just checking. Come here for a bit.”</p>

      <p>“I refuse.”</p>

      <p>“Of course... Actually, it’s faster for me to just get closer. Lend me your head.”</p>

      <p>Looking like he was more than ready to pick a fight, Suimei drew closer. As he did, Io Kuzami put on a smile like she was toying with him.</p>

      <p>“Did I not say that I refuse?”</p>

      <p>“Can’t hear you.”</p>

      <p>Promptly ignoring Io Kazumi, Suimei placed his hand on her head. He hadn’t been able to do anything for Hatsumi because she couldn’t remember who she was supposed to be, but in the case of a split personality, it was possible to return the original personality to dominance without any trauma. And so, despite feeling guilty about it, Suimei prepared to cast his magicka. But just as he did...</p>

      <p>“Bastard, do you intend to tamper with this little girl’s head again?”</p>

      <p>“!”</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami smirked like she knew exactly what Suimei was up to. Gripped with surprise, he took a step back. Io Kuzami then flashed another smirk—a much darker one.</p>

      <p>“What’s wrong? That’s not really something to be so startled over, is it?”</p>

      <p>“...What are you? And how the hell do you know that?”</p>

      <p>Suimei questioned her with a severe expression. What he’d done was supposed to be his secret and his secret alone. How could a split personality that had just suddenly appeared possibly know about it? Doubt and suspicion began whirling around in his head. Meanwhile, Io Kuzami simply continued smirking.</p>

      <p>“You’re making quite a grim face, but am I wrong? It’s something that happened before you bastards came to this world. Yes, this little girl had fallen in love with you, but you trampled on that love. Using your damned powers, you shifted her infatuation to a different target.”</p>

      <p>“...Yeah, that’s right.”</p>

      <p>It was true. At first, Mizuki was seriously interested in Reiji. But while Suimei was helping her approach Reiji, she’d ended up falling in love with him instead. And just as Io Kuzami said, Suimei had used magicka to deflect those feelings onto someone else. Being confronted with this now, Suimei gave Io Kuzami a dubious look. His eyes asked her how she knew all that.</p>

      <p>“It’s a trifling matter, really. When I possessed this little girl, I simply had a little peek at her memories. Of course, I also had a look at those damn memories that you sealed away.”</p>

      <p>It was then that Suimei somehow came to a vague understanding of just who Io Kuzami really was.</p>

      <p>“Answer me. What are you? What kind of spirit?”</p>

      <p>“There’s no need to be so angry. I have no intention of making any mischief. The reason that I am borrowing this little girl’s body is simply because our interests coincided. Besides, you are unable to remove me, correct?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t underestimate a modern magician. We’ve been exorcising things like you for ages with all kinds of magicka.”</p>

      <p>“Enough. You might even be able to do so with me, but the burden on this little girl will be considerable. It may just break her, you understand?”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>Suimei was unable to deny that. If what had possessed Mizuki was indeed a powerful being and he forcefully drove it out of her, it would come at a significant cost. And since he couldn’t argue, Suimei simply scowled at Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“What? Don’t make such a frightening face. There’s nothing to worry about. I have no intention of bringing any harm to this little girl, though she may yet go through some painful experiences.”</p>

      <p>“Is that the truth?”</p>

      <p>“I don’t lie.”</p>

      <p>That much he could be certain about. By their very nature, spirits did not lie. There were occasions that they avoided telling the truth or tricked people, but if a spirit wasn’t the mischievous type, they could be taken at their word. So if this being guaranteed Mizuki’s safety, Suimei had every reason to believe it. And so Suimei gave up on trying to drive whatever it was out by force. Io Kuzami then looked at him with a curious expression.</p>

      <p>“If this little girl is so precious to you, then why do you keep her at a distance?”</p>

      <p>“Shut up. I’m a magician, and Mizuki is a normal human. I have to draw a line to keep her safe.”</p>

      <p>“I see.”</p>

      <p>After a brief reply, Io Kuzami smirked once more.</p>

      <p>“Also, don’t mention any of this to the others. You hear me, bastard? This is a secret between the two of us.”</p>

      <p>And with that, whatever had possessed Mizuki laughed with her mouth.</p>
