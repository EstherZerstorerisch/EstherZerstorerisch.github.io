Chapter 2: Relation of the Summoned

“So the hero from the Alliance that was just in the parade...”

“Is Suimei-dono’s acquaintance?!”

Lefille and Felmenia’s shocked voices resounded throughout the room. After the hero’s victory parade, Suimei and the others gathered in the guild master’s office at the Twilight Pavilion. Suimei was now seated on the sofa with a profoundly grim expression on his face.

“There’s no mistaking that that girl was my childhood friend Kuchiba Hatsumi. To think that she got summoned too...”

Suimei answered the girls with a heavy sigh. Felmenia and the others were all completely astonished at the uncanny coincidence that Suimei was suggesting: he knew the Alliance hero from his own world.

“So not only did you get swallowed into your best friend’s summoning, but now your childhood friend’s been summoned here too? You’ve really gotten tangled in some hapless fate here, haven’t you?”

Unsure whether it was just dumb luck or the influence of the stars, Rumeya simply stared at Suimei in wonder with one eye shut as she puffed on her pipe. It really was just as she said. Suimei could think of no better way to describe it than “hapless fate.”

 There had to be something binding the people who’d been summoned to this world together—that’s what Suimei’s gut was now telling him. Pondering all this, Lefille recalled Suimei’s earlier actions.

“So that’s why you were yelling like that?”

“Yeah. I was trying to get her attention, but... I don’t get it. She didn’t react at all.”

“Could it be that it’s not really her, just someone who looks like her?”

“No. I mean, if it were just her looks, I might think that, but the clothes she’s wearing are a dead giveaway. Not to mention she has the same name.”

“Hatsumi Kuchiba, right? It’s true that the names match...”

“Yeah...”

Suimei was groaning at his wits’ end. Liliana then put her doubt into words.

“Couldn’t it simply be... that she didn’t hear you?”

“Maybe, but I swear our eyes met. She looked right at me. I find it hard to believe she didn’t recognize me then.”

“But it’s possible... there were just so many people... that she just overlooked you... right?”

“You think so? Maybe that’s all it was...”

Suimei nodded as if to convince himself. Just as Liliana said, there had been so many on the street earlier that it was genuinely possible she hadn’t been able to pick him out of the crowd. And nothing was going to be gained by fretting about it.

“I’m going to have to meet with her and see for myself.”
Hearing Suimei’s declaration, Rumeya managed to guess what was coming next.

“And that’s why you came to talk to me, right?”

“Yes. As a guild master, I thought you might be able to arrange a meeting with the hero.”

Even if Suimei was an old friend of hers, to the people of the Alliance, he was a nobody. It was difficult to imagine that they’d let just any civilian have an audience with the hero. That’s why he’d chosen to come to Rumeya, someone of importance in the community. 

He thought they might be able to get somewhere with her title. But contrary to his hopes, Rumeya shook her head sullenly.

“Sorry, that would be a little difficult.”

“Difficult... how?”

“Well, you see... According to the royal family, the hero doesn’t like to go out much. It hasn’t been all that long since she was summoned, so it seems she’s still rather unused to this world. The royal family doesn’t want her to get overwhelmed, so audiences with her have been prohibited.”

“I see... So is that why you haven’t met her yet either, Rumeya-dono?”

“You guessed it. The royal family of Miazen is quite high-strung about anything and everything concerning the hero. Even if I pulled all the strings I could and threw around my weight, I doubt they’d let us see her.”

“That seems strange after letting her fight and making her participate in a parade.”

“Doesn’t it? I honestly don’t know what they’re thinking either.”

Rumeya completely agreed with Suimei. It seemed she had her own suspicions on the matter, and continued to puff away on her pipe with a dissatisfied expression. It was Felmenia who timidly spoke up next.

“So the hero from the Alliance is your, um... good friend, right, Suimei-dono? Does that mean she’s... on your mind?”

“Well, yeah.”

When Suimei smiled, Rumeya flashed a wicked grin.

“Oh? Goodness me, what a ladykiller. You’re already practically drowning in beautiful women, yet you’re still on the prowl for a new catch? You’re a bad boy, aren’t you?” she said, twirling her pipe around the end of her finger.

“Wha...? N-No! That’s really not...”

Naturally, Suimei had no such intentions and readily denied her accusation, but Felmenia and Lefille weren’t so convinced. Felmenia leaped towards him while Lefille cast a cold, terrifying look his way.

“S-Suimei-dono, is that true?! Are those really your intentions?!”

“Suimei-kun, it seems you and I need to have a long, long talk.”

“Calm down, Menia! I just— Wait, Lefille... why are you looking at me like that?”

Suimei was reeling at the sudden change in their attitudes. Rumeya got a hearty laugh out of it.

“Well, all joking aside...”

“After throwing me under the bus like that? You got some nerve...”

Suimei glared at Rumeya, the resentment obvious in his eyes. But she merely returned a foxy smile, as though she’d found some new toy to play with.

“Suimei, it’s quite amusing to tease you, you know? Surely people did this to you, even in the world you hail from.”
“Urgh...”

“Hahaha! That must mean I hit the bullseye! Seems that’s just your lot in life, my dear.”

Rumeya continued laughing, thoroughly amused with Suimei. As he lamented in his heart that he’d made yet another enemy, the smile suddenly disappeared from her face as she regained her composure and looked at him seriously.

“So, she’s on your mind because she’s your friend?”

“Yes. I’ve known her since I was very young. That’s why I want to check on her. I don’t know for sure that she isn’t being forced to fight against her will, after all.”

“Hmm...”

It seemed Rumeya hadn’t considered that possibility. The people of this world by and large took for granted that the heroes came to save them. Of course they would be willing to fight. The idea that that might not be the case never even crossed most of their minds.

 For Suimei, however, it was a natural enough worry.
Moreover, he still couldn’t quite get his head around why Reiji and Elliot had taken up such a baffling stance on this hero business. It made no sense to him, and he didn’t think he’d get to the bottom of it until he took a serious look into it for himself. Talking to Hatsumi might prove to be a good start. After calming down a bit, Felmenia cocked her head to the side and raised a question as to how exactly he’d go about doing that.

“But what will you do, Suimei-dono? If we cannot make an appointment with her directly, do you have some other way to reach her?”

“Well, if it comes to that, I do have a card up my sleeve...”

While stroking his chin, Suimei shifted his focus to the window. Night—the magician’s day—was just about to fall. If Suimei couldn’t get in touch with Hatsumi by normal means, he’d have to get creative.

★
Kuchiba Hatsumi suddenly felt a jolt run through her body.
“Hmm...?”

She slowly stirred from a deep slumber, and when she opened her eyes, she saw her companion Selphy Fittney leaning over her.

“Please wake up, Hatsumi. It’s already nighttime.”
“Evening...?”

While rubbing her sleepy eyes, she straightened herself up and looked around. She was on top of a bed in the private room that had been set aside for her on the fourth floor of Miazen’s palace. The furnishings were kept to a bare minimum, with only the bed and a dresser for clothing. A dark carpet spread across the floor, and a wide courtyard could be seen from the window. These were the frugal lodgings the royal family had allotted her.

Her face concealed by her hood, Selphy quietly continued to speak to Hatsumi.

“Indeed, Hatsumi. You worked hard today.”

“...I fell asleep?”

“Yes, you were out like a light. You must have been having a good dream, though. Your sleeping face was very peaceful.”

“Augh...”

Hatsumi couldn’t hide her bashfulness at the thought of someone seeing her sleeping face. Her cheeks turned bright red, but rather than trying to embarrass her, Selphy was being somewhat affectionate. Hatsumi couldn’t see her face due to the shadow, but she felt like Selphy was smiling underneath that hood of hers.

“What kind of dream were you having? Do you remember?”
“My dream...?”

She tried to recall its contents. And sure enough...
“...I dreamt I was a small child. In a place different from here. I was racing a boy and horsing around with him.”

“The same dream as always, then?”

Hatsumi nodded towards Selphy’s gentle voice. She had no memories or her previous life, but it was a dream she had often. In it, she was a small child, and she was with a boy about her age. They would play around and swing swords together. She had no evidence to prove it, but she thought it must be a fragment of her past.

But then...

But then partway through, it shifted to a strange dream. There was a stray dog. She was running from it, but fell and hurt herself. The boy chased it off for her. Then he recited a good luck charm to heal her wounds. And at last, he said...

“Whenever you’re in danger, I’ll come save you.”

The boy’s face was completely hazy in her mind. She couldn’t remember it clearly. But when she recalled those words of his, there was a faint ache in her chest. It felt like the pang of loneliness that came after losing something.

Setting the matter of the dream aside, Hatsumi was surprised at herself. She’d only intended to take a quick nap, but she’d completely passed out. Somewhat disoriented, she turned to her companion.

“Selphy, just how long was I asleep?”

“I told you it’s nighttime already. You were out for quite a while.”

“Man, I really slept that much...? We were supposed to have that strategic meeting this evening, weren’t we?”

“Indeed we were.”

“Aw man...”
After Hatsumi and her companions had dinner after the parade, they decided to take a short break before meeting to discuss how they should proceed in regards to the demon subjugation. Hatsumi, as the leader, had suggested they reconvene in an hour for said meeting, but looking out the window now, it was pitch black outside. Her little post-dinner nap had lasted for well over two hours.

“The hour has gotten quite late, so I came to wake you.”
“It would’ve been fine if you’d done so earlier.”

“No, you seemed quite tired, so I thought it would be best to let you rest.”

“Thank you, Selphy. So, where are Gaius and Weitzer?

“They’re waiting in the next room over.”

“I see. Then let’s hurry—”

Before Hatsumi could finish her sentence, she could hear antsy footsteps from the hallway. It was Gaius; he must have sensed that she had woken up. And just as Hatsumi realized who was approaching, the door to her room burst open without so much as a knock.

“Yoohoo! Is the little sleepyhead hero awake yet?”

That door must have been nothing but a single sheet of veneer to him. As it banged open like it had been punched, a burly, musclebound man with an affable smile came marching in and plunked right down on a chair like it belonged to him.

 Selphy’s eyes glinted reproachfully from under her hood.
“Sir Gaius, what are you doing entering a woman’s room without even knocking?”

“Aw, what’s the big deal? She was just sleeping in the clothes she usually wears, right? If she were immodestly dressed, I’m sure you’da done something about it already.”

“Well, that much is certainly true. I would have started by firing a spell at you.”

“Oooh, scary.”

Gaius grabbed both his shoulders and pretended to shiver in fright. Though he didn’t think of it that way, he was quite a droll man. Hatsumi, however, didn’t really mind Gaius’s impolite behavior. She lightly bowed her head to him from atop her bed.

“I’m sorry, Gaius. I overslept.”

“That’s rare for you.”

“I think doing something new must have tired me out...”
Hatsumi spoke timidly. It had come up during dinner as well, but that afternoon had been her first experience with a parade. For half a day, she had to stand atop a cowhorn-drawn float while waving and smiling at the cheering crowds. It was a lot more difficult than she’d thought.

“Ah, yeah, I get you there. Even my beautiful shoulders are stiff after all that.”

Gaius was rubbing his shoulder while making a bitter face. Even though he was a rather worldly man, it seemed he wasn’t used to such things either. Hatsumi had thought he looked like he was having quite a lot of fun during the parade, but it seemed perhaps that wasn’t the case after all. 

As they were talking about all this, a young man wearing an exquisite knight’s outfit came through the still-open door. And the first thing that came out of his mouth was...

“Gaius. Just what are you thinking, marching into the hero’s room on your own like that?”

Glaring at Gaius out of the corner of his eye, the newcomer criticized him in a sharp tone. It was Weitzer Ryerzen, prince of Miazen. Gaius, however, sat there unfazed, digging around his ear with his pinky finger while he waited for the prince to stop talking.

“What? You gonna lecture me too? Like I said, what’s the big deal? I could hear them talking and all, so I knew she was awake. Come on, already. I wanna get the depressing talk out of the way so I can go get some booze.”

“Are you saying you’re more concerned with spirits than the peace of the world?”

“Sure am.”

Gaius struck his chest proudly, not hesitating to answer. Pinching his brow in displeasure at such arrogance, Weitzer judged that any further conversation with such an oaf would be unproductive. With a much softened 
expression, he turned to Hatsumi instead to greet her.

“I deeply apologize for being so boisterous when you’ve just awoken, Hero-dono. Did you sleep well?”

“Yes, thank you. And I’m sorry for making you wait.”

“Not at all. You must still be fatigued from battle. We’re the ones repeatedly dragging you into combat, after all. So I implore you to think nothing of it, Hero-dono.”

“Yeah...”

Weitzer made it a point to be courteous so as not to make Hatsumi uncomfortable. As always, he was quite the gentleman. Hatsumi, knowing what serious conversation lay ahead of them, went to get up from the bed. Selphy moved to lend her a hand as she rose, but Weitzer held her back for some reason.

“Selphy, leave this to me.”

“...Very well.”

Selphy questioned Weitzer’s actions for a moment, but quickly came to a realization and gracefully resigned herself. Seeing this exchange left Hatsumi puzzled as Weitzer drew closer.

“W-Weitzer?”

“Now then, Hero-dono, please take my hand.”

“Huh? Oh... Th-Thank you...”

Weitzer extended his hand to Hatsumi for support. Worried about her, he smiled at her gently to encourage her. Hatsumi bashfully looked away as she thanked him. This kind of behavior was fairly common for him, but it was still quite embarrassing. Nevertheless, she took his hand and stood up. Their other two companions were quietly laughing like something was most amusing.

“Ah, so the prince is goin’ on the offensive, eh?”

“Heh...”

Weitzer escorted Hatsumi over to where they were sitting.
“Hero-dono, how did you enjoy tonight’s dinner?”

“Well, the food was delicious, but...”

“Was there something about it you weren’t pleased with?”
“That’s not it. It’s just that dealing with that kind of atmosphere isn’t easy. Ah, but I don’t mean to say I dislike being around His and Her Majesty, understand?”
Hatsumi actually got along fairly well not just with the king and queen, but with everyone in the palace. Yet even then, it made her anxious to dine under such pomp and circumstance.

 She was never able to fully relax with all the formalities. She wasn’t sure how Weitzer had interpreted what she said about it, but he replied with the air of a know-it-all.

“But of course. You’ve lost your memory, after all. I’m sure, after some time, things will come back to you and you’ll be much more comfortable under such circumstances.”

“That’s not really what I mean though...”

“You will get used to it soon, Hero-dono. I think it’s already growing on you. Your manners at the dinner table are always impeccable, after all.”

“Y-Yeah...”

Hatsumi could only muster an awkward reply to Weitzer’s praise. She didn’t understand how he could flatter her like that with such a straight face. After taking her seat, she caught a glimpse of Gaius grinning. Selphy too was stifling a laugh. She wasn’t sure what was so funny.

“I see the two of you behave this way from time to time... but what is it?”

“Ah, it’s nothing.”

“Indeed. We were just making small talk.”

The two of them seemed in rather good spirits. Weitzer, on the other hand, looked rather offended, though that only made Gaius smile more. He waited for Weitzer to take a seat before addressing him.

“So, what’ll we do from here?”

“I don’t really think there is anything to do.”

“Aw, come on, don’t be like that. You angry about something?”

“Certainly not.”

Despite what he said, Weitzer did seem irritated. Cutting into their little exchange, Hatsumi got the conversation back on track.

“It’s a matter of course that we’ll continue subjugating the demons, but how shall we proceed from here?”

“Ain’t it fine just to link up with the soldiers and march on the bastards like usual?”

“I also think it is a good idea to proceed as we have been, Hero-dono.”

In a strange turn of events, Weitzer agreed with Gaius. And if the two of them were united, it had to mean it was a solid plan. However, Hatsumi had different thoughts on the matter.

“That may be, but...”

“You thinkin’ about something else, Hatsumi?”

“Yeah. Since we have this kind of war potential, I was thinking that there’s probably a better way to use it. I mean, we’ve already raised the soldiers’ morale considerably with a big victory. And morale only gets but so high, right? So I was thinking it might be better to leave the battlefield to the generals from here on out.”

“Huh?”

Gaius didn’t quite follow, but Weitzer seemed to grasp her proposition immediately.

“In other words, you’re saying it would be better for us to move against the demons independently now.”

“Yeah, I was thinking it’s a possibility. We could make a surprise attack against the demon generals or something. Though it may be a dangerous play...”

“Certainly. But if it is a success, then the burden on the soldiers would be lightened remarkably.”

Their party was peerless in terms of strength and 
potential on the battlefield. They had three members who could each fight against the demons head-on, and one who could support them from the rear lines perfectly. As a group, they were also well-suited for covert operations. If they could take the initiative now and eliminate the demon generals and other influential demons, they could claim a real victory for humanity in this war.

“Knowing that, we’ll only proceed this way if everyone’s willing.”

Just as Hatsumi’s apprehensions indicated, it was indeed a dangerous plan. It would put a great deal of pressure on all four of them. However, Weitzer answered her confidently as if it were only natural.

“But of course. We intend to follow you wherever, Hero-dono.”

“Even if you’re okay with it, there’s still Gaius and Selphy to consider. They both have their own countries to worry about. You don’t make decisions for them, so don’t try and speak for them. Besides, frankly speaking, I’m not completely decided on this plan yet either.”

“M-My apologies...”

After being rebuked, Weitzer apologized in an uncharacteristic fluster. It seemed the pointed nature of her harsh words had gotten to him. But while he was still reeling over his blunder, Gaius gave his own confident answer.

“I don’t mind at all. I’m tired of getting stalled, anyways. Danger is just what I want.”

“I shall also accompany you. I have no intention of abandoning my duty after we’ve come this far,” Selphy added.

“Thank you. Both of you.”

The two of them—or really, all three of them—were rather promising. Hatsumi expressed her gratitude for their dedication, but Gaius looked at her as though he’d seen something odd.

“At any rate, Hatsumi, you weren’t like this before. I’m surprised you got so pumped up.”

It seemed he was surprised by her sudden proposal for an aggressive move. When she first came to this world, she refused to have anything to do with the subjugation and locked herself away in her room from the shock of losing her memories. Gaius was likely comparing the way she was now to the way she was then, but...

“You promised not to bring that up, didn’t you? Jeez... Nothing’s changed. I just know we need to defeat the demons now.”

After fighting the demons for herself, Hatsumi realized what must be done. Perhaps it was their strength, their malicious intent, their sinister auras... She just knew in her heart of hearts that they were an evil that must be vanquished.

 Moreover, she wanted to protect the people of this world—including the three companions who fought alongside her. They were important to her.

“Hey, Selphy, is there anything we need to be doing in Miazen right now?”

“Not particularly. Just keep in mind that there are evening parties you must attend.”

“Evening parties... Why?”

Hatsumi realized the importance of the parade in lifting the citizens’ spirits, but she didn’t think anything more than that would be necessary.

 Though she’d posed the question to Selphy, Weitzer was the one to reply.

“It is because I would like us to deepen our friendship.”

“Don’t we all get along well enough already?”

Hatsumi had known the three of them ever since her first battle. It hadn’t been all that long since they’d actually met, but through the bonds of trust and friendship they’d formed on the battlefield, they became like family to one another. 

She didn’t see how they could possibly need something as silly as a party to solidify that. However...
“My apologies. I spoke poorly there. By ‘us,’ I mean the people of the Saadias Alliance. I believe that you should properly spend some time with my father and mother, as well as the other leaders from Miazen and the leaders of the other Alliance countries.”

“That’s... I certainly don’t mind meeting with them, but it’s not like we’re in a hurry for that.”

“Actually, Hero-dono, this is a matter of urgent business for the Alliance. If we act right away, then...”

“Are you saying that I should be a dish served to put the Alliance in order?”

“N-No! That is not what I’m—”

“The demons are invading. I don’t think there’s anything more urgent than that.”

She knew what Weitzer was asking her to do was necessary, but she still didn’t like the idea.

“You’re mistaken, Hero-dono! This isn’t about using you for political means...”

Seeing the complex expression on Hatsumi’s face, Weitzer was frantically trying to correct himself, thinking that he had offended her.

 Meanwhile, Gaius let out his usual dauntless laugh as he turned to Hatsumi.

“It’s about you time you took a hint, innit, Hatsumi?”
“Take a hint? About what?”

“Little Prince Weitzer’s goodwill.”

“His goodwill? It’s true that I feel a bit bad for everything he and the others here are doing for me...”

After being summoned, not just Weitzer, but the entire palace had taken good care of Hatsumi. That was as things should be, considering they were the ones who summoned her, but Hatsumi was still grateful. 

She made sure to express this, but Gaius let out an astonished sigh.

“How do I put it...? To put it bluntly, you’re amazingly dense. You kinda remind me of that spindly lad I had a meal with a while back...”

Hatsumi had no idea what he was talking about. But after calming down a fair bit, Weitzer collected himself and tried to clarify.

“It is certainly true, Hero-dono, that your help is a considerable boon to the Alliance. That much goes without saying. But I am thinking ahead—to after we defeat the demons. And I believe this is a necessary part of making a future for you. If you are anxious without your memories, then I will support you for the rest of your life.”

“But... I don’t want to be that much of a burden to you, Weitzer.”

“I-I don’t at all think of you as a burden!”
“But...”

Hatsumi couldn’t just agree to his offer, no matter how kind and generous. She had no intention of weighing him down the rest of his life like that. Besides, she had her own world to return to. Somewhere she knew she had to get back. It was that boy that appeared in her dreams... She felt like she had to see him again no matter what.

“...”

But she couldn’t let those thoughts overtake her. If she thought of nothing but that boy whose face was lost somewhere in the misty haze of her mind, her brain would cease functioning. Sensing the subtleties of her heart from the color of her face, Weitzer looked at her with a worried expression.

“...Hero-dono?”

“Sorry. I think we’re done here, so please leave me be for a while.”

“Hatsumi?”

“Yeah, I’m alright. Thank you, Selphy.”

When Selphy called out to her, Hatsumi smiled back as if to tell her not to worry. After Weitzer apologetically excused himself, all three guests exited the room. Once the door was closed, Hatsumi stood up from her chair and threw herself back onto the bed. She looked idly up at tapestry affixed to the ceiling, and her true feelings escaped her lips in a sigh.

“...I must return to where I came from...”

Her companions were important to her, but she didn’t want to abandon her memories. She wanted to know who she was. Back home—wherever that may be—there might even be someone waiting for her. That’s why...

“And... up we go!”

In the midst of ruminating, Hatsumi heard that casual voice come from her window, which was wide open. Curious, she turned her head to look while still sprawled out on her bed. And there, as if he’d just climbed up, was a young man squatted in the windowsill.

“Yo!”

“Huh?! What?! Whaaat?!”

The young man—who had black hair and was dressed in green—had appeared out of seemingly nowhere, but casually waved to her in a greeting. Hatsumi bolted right up out of her bed in surprise.

“W-Wait, this is the fourth floor!”

“And? It’s not like you can’t climb up four stories, you know? You use these protrusions as handholds. See? It just takes a little elbow grease and determination. Not that that’s what I did.”

While pantomiming climbing, the young man spoke to her as if nothing about the situation were strange at all. It was true there were a number of ways to climb up to the fourth floor; the real problem was what came before that.

“H-How did you get into the inner grounds of the palace?!”

“All that took was a little something...”

Saying that, the young man pressed his index finger to his thumb. It seemed he meant to suggest it had been a simple affair. 

After that, he jumped down from the window into the room like it was his prerogative to do so. Just who was he? Ignoring the particulars of his identity for the moment, Hatsumi grabbed her sword, which was leaning up against the wall nearby. She took a stance with it readied at her hip, looking like she was ready to cut him in half at the drop of a hat.

“Don’t move!”

It was a warning. But then, as if the young man hadn’t understood what she was saying, he stiffened up like time had stopped. He stared at her blankly for a while, and then let out a simple, stupefied question.

“...Huh?”

“Don’t ‘huh’ me, you trespasser! Should I slay you on the spot?!”

She reissued her warning to the young man looking at her with a rather idiotic look on his face. After freezing up again, he finally seemed to pick up on her seriousness and started panicking.

“Slay? As in... kill me? Come on, you’re not the type to make jokes like that, right?”

“Yes, I’m surprised you know. It’s not a joke.”

“I-It’s not a joke...? Just what the hell are you saying?! Are you seriously planning to kill me?! For real?! Are you angry ’cause I snuck into a lady’s bedroom? I mean, yeah, I did do that, but...”

“Wrong.”

“Then what is it?!”

Hatsumi stared daggers into him like she truly did mean to slay him where he stood. She had no idea why he seemed to be so surprised about this. Considering what he was doing, he should have expected this kind of response.

“Do I really have to spell it out for you? Anyone would defend themselves with a stranger sneaking into their room.”

“Stranger, you say...?”

“At the very least, I don’t recognize you... At all.”

After coming to this world, she had not once met this young man. So why was he standing there with a bewildered expression like she’d just told a close friend she didn’t know them? She couldn’t understand it. The only thing that was clear was that he did indeed seem to be quite shaken.

“D-Don’t joke around. This ain’t the kind of place for that crap, okay?”

“Didn’t I say I wasn’t joking? I don’t know you.”

“There’s no way you don’t! I’m Suimei! Yakagi Suimei, your childhood friend!”

“Ch-Childhood friend?”

“Yeah. So I’m begging you... Please spare your childhood friend the jokes.”

The young man, Yakagi Suimei, let out an agonized groan like he was at his wits’ end. She hadn’t expected him to introduce himself that way, but his attitude up until now did seem to corroborate it. He was certainly acting as if they were close. But there was one glaring hole in that story.

“Just what are you saying? I’m a hero summoned from another world, you know? There’s no way I have childhood friends in this place.”

This young man may have had a good reason for infiltrating the palace, but as far as setups and excuses went, this was just too ill-conceived. 

Nevertheless, when she pointed that out to him, he looked as though she’d stabbed him. He then slowly arched a suspicious eyebrow.

“Hey, what gives? Your memories fly the coop or something?”

“Indeed, it is just as you say. I have amnesia.”

“Wait, seriously...?”

The young man now stared at her in complete disbelief.

★

When Suimei was a young child, one of his father’s good friends was a swordsmanship expert. His father convinced him to move to the area and open up a dojo in the neighborhood. 

The style of swordsmanship this man practiced was known as the Phantom Sword of the Kurikara Dharani. It was an old style that had been passed down since long before even the Warring States period.

 It originated from its namesake, a dharani—a ritual speech much like a mantra—based on the dragon sword Kurikara wielded by the wrathful Buddhist god Acala, which was used to make demonic spirits and other otherworldly beings capitulate. The sword style inherited that feature. Not only could it be used against humans, it was also effective against spirits, apparitions, and even monsters.

Naturally, that wasn’t the only thing taught in the dojo. The instructor, Kuchiba Kiyoshiro, also taught mundane swordsmanship to the neighborhood children. But behind the scenes, he used his true skills to cut down the monsters running rampant in the world. 

His daughter, Kuchiba Hatsumi, was following in his footsteps and had also taken up the practice under his tutelage.

With the way things had worked out, Hatsumi didn’t actually know that Suimei was a magician or that he knew about the secret work her family did, but that wasn’t really the issue at the moment. The point was that her skill with a blade was extraordinary. 

So much so that her father considered it a shame she’d been born a girl. Even with relatively little combat in this world, Suimei could guess that she was probably on par with the Seven Swords. And this girl was standing before him now with her sword raised against him.

“So should I call the guards? Or would you rather be cut down where you stand?”

“Neither, preferably. Both would be a lot of trouble.”

“I find this current situation to be trouble. There’s a strange man in my room, after all.”

“Gimme a break...”

Suimei was floundering. The girl that he’d played with ever since she moved to his neighborhood so many years ago was claiming not to know who he was. 

That girl—the very same one he’d learned swordsmanship with—was now lowering her posture in preparation to lash out at him with her blade. The aura he could sense from her told him she wasn’t messing around, either. 

One wrong move right now and he would taste her steel for sure.
But what on earth was he supposed to do about her amnesia? He’d come with the intention of taking her back with him if it was necessary, but he had no idea what the right thing to do in this situation was. 

As long as she didn’t remember him, she wouldn’t go with him even if he asked nicely. He had his magicka, but that couldn’t fix amnesia. There were spells to manipulate the brain and rewrite memories, but if he took that path and forcefully pushed memories into her, there was no doubt that it would put a considerable strain on her mind.
Ultimately, that left him emptyhanded. 

It was completely vexing. With all his other options a bust, the only thing he could do was try to talk to her until she believed him.

“Hahh...”

Suimei heard Hatsumi exhale. It made him nervous. The blade on her weapon was about 120 centimeters long, and the grip was about another 25. There were some strange ornaments decorating it, but it had the overall shape of a Japanese-style sword, or something imitating one. 

Within that red scabbard at her hip was undoubtedly a deadly weapon made of a special material from this world.
And right now, Suimei was standing about nine centimeters inside its reach. 

In other words, she could cut him down from where she stood without taking a single step. No... He knew better than that. Even if her blade hadn’t been able reach him, he was still well within her reach.

A sword master who passed a certain threshold in ability was able to strike outside the range of their weapon. It was impossible physically speaking, but to put it simply, with a horizontal slash, they could cut down anything and everything before them like a wall of clouds split by the wind. Such a feat was possible with the sword style this girl used. Her blade was one that defied logic.

“The Kuchiba school of the Phantom Sword of the Kurikara Dharani. Even with amnesia, you didn’t forget your sword style, right?” Suimei asked, wiping away the unpleasant sweat forming on his brow.

“You know of it?” Hatsumi asked in turn, looking surprised.

“Like I said, I am your childhood friend...”

“I don’t believe that.”

“Why not?”

“If it were true, why did you come in that way? Couldn’t you have just gone through the front door?”

“Nope. I had to do this precisely because that wasn’t an option.”

“Hmph. Does that mean you have something to hide?”
“Now you’re just splitting hairs...”

Suimei spoke in exasperation. The guards and soldiers were one thing, but he hadn’t expected he’d need to defend himself to his childhood friend.

“Then can you prove it? It certainly looks like you know about my sword style, but it’s possible you figured that out using some kind of spell like the mages and demons. So that alone isn’t proof that you’re my childhood friend.”

“Ugh...”

He couldn’t argue there. He had no other definitive proof capable of convincing her immediately either. He did have a picture he’d taken of her with her family on his phone, but his battery was long since dead. 

That wouldn’t work. He could still take her with him by force, but it wasn’t like that would bring her memories back. There would also be a huge commotion if the hero were abducted.

While Suimei was racking his brain trying to come up with an alternative solution, he heard violent footsteps racing down the hall outside. Someone had sensed something. 

Before Suimei could even use his magicka, a woman’s voice was coming from other side of the door.

“Hatsumi?! Is something wrong?!” the stranger called.

“Ah, Selphy! It’s an intruder!” Hatsumi shouted back.

“Are you talking about me?!” Suimei demanded.

“Who else?!” she roared.

And with those words came a flash of her blade. Suimei jumped back towards the window to dodge it. The tip of her long blade then changed its trajectory at a right angle, and her slash became a thrust. 

The blade, made from corroded silver, sliced through the air with a sharp whistling sound. The tip of it was reaching out for Suimei’s stomach. He just barely managed to dodge it and escape deeper into the room.

“Are you trying to kill me?!”

“Just skewer you a bit. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure to avoid your vitals.”

“Don’t tell me not to worry, damn it! That’s still freakin’ dangerous!”

Immediately following their brief exchange, the door opened with a bang. The person who came in, presumably the woman who’d called out to Hatsumi a minute ago, was dressed in a green robe. Suimei recognized her as the mage who was standing atop one of the festival floats during the parade.

“Hatsumi! Are you safe?”

“Yes, we’ve just got an intruder on our hands... But you’re outnumbered now, you see. Just give up already.”

“Indeed. I don’t know who you are or how you infiltrated the palace, but there’s no escape for you now.”

It was true. The mage woman had the door covered, and the window was now well within the range of Hatsumi’s blade. Even where he was standing was dangerous. Hatsumi could probably hit anywhere in the room with her skills. Which meant...

“If there’s no way to escape, then I just have to make one!”

Gathering mana in his fist, Suimei lashed out at the wall and invoked his magicka. His fist let out a powerful shockwave as he thrust it forward, a ripple of etheric. And when his fist met the wall, a section of it was blown outward and reduced to rubble.

Suimei could hear cursing and groaning behind him. The two women had likely been forced to give their undivided attention to protecting themselves from the shockwave. 

Using that opportunity, Suimei threw himself through the hole in the wall he’d created. The building was four stories tall, and they were on the fourth floor right now. But to a magician, such a meager height was nothing to be concerned about.

 A fall like that was but a trifle.
In the dead of the night, Suimei could hear the sound of the wind rushing up to meet him as the ground drew imminently nearer. Suimei landed safely with his magicka and began to take off... but for some reason, he could hear the voice of the woman Hatsumi had called Selphy ringing in his ear.

“An intruder has appeared in the palace—a young man with black hair wearing green clothing. After breaking into the hero’s room, he’s now trying to escape through the courtyard. All guards are to report there. I repeat...”

It was a simple alarm. The robed woman was a mage, and seemed to specialize in wind magic. The wind was carrying her voice to every nook and cranny of the palace.

 And thanks to that, Suimei could immediately hear footsteps coming his way. He ran over to the edge of the courtyard, but there were suddenly soldiers swarming from every direction.

“I found him! Over there!”

“Spread out and surround him! We cannot let a ruffian who snuck into the palace escape!”

“Tch... They sure came out in force.”

He must have picked a bad place to land. There was nowhere to hide in the courtyard, and there was quite some distance between him and the next building. After being surrounded by the soldiers, Suimei heard a familiar voice from the back of the group.

“Huh? Aren’t you that spindly lad from the other day?!”
The surprised man addressing him was the jovial man he’d met at the restaurant back in Grafille, Gaius Forvan. With his back pressed up against the courtyard wall, Suimei replied in a lighthearted tone as if nothing were wrong.

“Aah, we meet again, geezer. Long time no see.”

“It hasn’t been that long and I ain’t no geezer, damn it! What’s going on here, lad? Are you the intruder?”

“It’s complicated. Like, I’m in this deeper than the Mariana Trench complicated.”

“You playing dumb? I’ll give you a whooping if you are, you know?”

“By the looks of it, I think someone else is probably gonna cut me down before you get that far.”

Suimei could see the surrounding soldiers’ eyes glinting just like their drawn swords. They all seemed to be quite offended that he infiltrated not just the palace, but the hero’s room. Before long, one more person arrived. The crowd of soldiers parted, and another one of Hatsumi’s companions emerged.

 If Suimei remembered right from the parade, he was Miazen’s prince, Weitzer Ryerzen.

“Gaius, do you know this man?” he asked, a calm and composed air about him.

“Not well. He’s just some lad I shared a table with at a restaurant,” Gaius responded nonchalantly.

“I see.”

After confirming that much, Weitzer drew his sword and turned his attention to Suimei.

“Not only did you perform the foolish act of trespassing in Calnus Palace, scoundrel, you dared to set foot in the hero’s bedroom. You understand what will happen to you, correct?”

Suimei met Weitzer’s quiet, yet overpowering voice with a grand sigh.

“Just so you know, I only came here to see an old friend of mine.”

“A friend, you say?”

“I mean Hatsumi. Though it seems she doesn’t recognize me at all thanks to the whole amnesia thing...”

“...”

“What nonsense. The hero was summoned from another world. She has no ‘old friends’ here.”

Gaius knit his brow and looked at Suimei curiously while Weitzer boldly declared Suimei a liar. Seeing their reactions, Suimei hung his head in defeat.

“Well, the prince is right, ain’t he?”

The sound of Gaius cracking his knuckles reverberated through the air.

“Well, whatever the case, seems like we got a whole lotta questions for you, lad. Just be a good boy and be obedient for now.”

“This isn’t really the kind of situation where you guys are going to go easy on me just because I behave myself now...”

“Naturally. There’s no need to show an intruder like you mercy. Just be grateful that we didn’t dice you to pieces on sight.”

Gaius was speaking to Suimei in a rather friendly fashion, but Weitzer’s tone was as sharp as his blade. The other soldiers still looked ready for a fight, too. To escape, Suimei would have to get past them, as well as Gaius and Weitzer.

“You guys aren’t gonna give me a choice about this, are you...?”

Suimei lamented the situation with a long, fraught sigh. And then, in spite of the courtyard being in direct moonlight, his figure sank into the shadows.

★

Meanwhile, the guild master of the Twilight Pavilion’s Miazen branch, Rumeya, was also at the palace. Hearing that Suimei was planning on infiltrating to make contact with the Alliance’s hero, she thought she’d take the opportunity to do a little snooping herself.

Of course, her reason for doing so could be summed up simply with “it sounded like fun.” She had her position to consider, but being a therianthrope, she was something of a pleasure-seeker by nature. 

She just couldn’t resist the idea of adventure when it came knocking. Normally, due to her fox ears and seven tails, she stood out quite a bit. But right now, she was impersonating a palace guard with the transformation techniques passed down by the golden fox clan.

She’d lost sight of Suimei in a corridor not too long after entering the palace, but she’d just now heard a voice on the wind proclaiming the presence of an intruder. As the message echoed through the palace grounds, guards carrying lamps began rushing towards the courtyard with a flurry of angry shouting.

“...Good grief, did that boy blow it?”

Rumeya grimaced. Suimei used magic from another world and seemed to possess a considerable amount of power, so she’d thought she had nothing to worry about. Apparently that was careless to assume.

This’ll get ugly if I don’t go to save him...
Lefille had told Rumeya all about Suimei’s true strength. It was impressive, but so were the palace guards. There were also the hero’s companions around.

 Even being a mage from another world, Suimei would likely end up caught. But since he was Lefille’s benefactor, Rumeya couldn’t just abandon him. She let out a sigh like she considered this all quite troublesome, and began heading for the courtyard herself when she suddenly noticed something strange.

“...?”

It had suddenly gotten darker. She reflexively looked up overhead as a few clouds began to float by in front of the moon. Perhaps they were the cause... 

Or at least part of it. The moon still wasn’t completely covered, so Rumeya didn’t think that was the only factor at play.

But Rumeya knew she didn’t have time to stand around contemplating the odd darkness, so she shook off such thoughts and continued towards the courtyard. Suimei was there, surrounded by Gaius Forvan, Weitzer Ryerzen, and a mob of palace guards. All the actors were in place. Suimei had his back up against a wall, and it seemed the play was just about to reach its climax.

“Goodness me... Isn’t this just the worst case scenario?”
After slipping into the mob and blending in with the guards, she grimaced at the scene unfolding in front of her. Things would have been better if Suimei were on the run, but corned like so, she didn’t think he’d be walking away from this unharmed. More guards were still steadily gathering, and they had now formed an impenetrable semi-circle around Suimei.

Escaping would no longer be a simple matter. That mysterious mage from the self-governed state—the one they called the Snowstorm—was probably also around here somewhere too. Would she burst onto the scene while the guards tried to capture Suimei? No. Contrary to all of Rumeya’s expectations, this wasn’t the end of the play, but the start of the second act.

The palace guards charged in to detain Suimei, but he only shrugged his shoulders at their approach. Just then, something caused the mana lamps installed in the courtyard as well as the lamps being held by the guards to start flickering.

They were flashing in and out at random intervals, and eventually, as if they’d all given up the ghost, light vanished from the courtyard completely. In the brief instant where the guards were bewildered by this unexpected turn of events, the very air around Suimei seemed to waver. It was like he was covered in a heat haze. Suimei himself wasn’t moving. His bangs obscured his face, and Rumeya could see nothing of his expression. But despite the predicament he was in, he stood stock-still and did nothing.

However, the moment she did finally manage to get a good look at Suimei through that transparent haze, a shiver ran through her body. It didn’t feel like the malice that came from demons, but right now, Suimei was giving off a strangely eerie feeling. It felt like she was staring dread right in the eyes. Like the darkness around her was thick enough to be tangible.

And then, without warning, all the guards who were moving in on Suimei fell to the ground with a clang.

“Wha—?!”

Witnessing them all collapse with no logical explanation, she couldn’t help gasping. The other guards and the hero’s companions did the same. Alarmed, they all began stirring in the darkness. During this confusion, even the palace guards further in the back began to fall over as they lost consciousness.

The only ones left standing were Gaius, Weitzer, and a select handful of the palace guard. The hero’s companions appeared unfazed, but even the hardier guards were spooked. Rumeya thought she could all see them sweating profusely. Gaius, after carefully looking around at the fallen men, turned to Suimei.

“...The hell did you just do?”

“As you can see, I knocked them out.”

“You... knocked them out?”

Gaius seemed completely bewildered at Suimei’s brief reply. Weitzer, on the other hand, had much more to say.

“Without magic? Without even touching them? How suspect, indeed! What the hell did you do, bastard?!”

“I’d just be repeating myself at this point.”

“Do you intend to deceive me with those words? Impossible! Are you suggesting you knocked them out just by thinking it? Well, you bastard?”

“Correct. The very ‘impossibility’ you speak of.”

As his statement hung in the air without any pretense, Weitzer replied in a somewhat disgusted tone.

“Enough with your nonsense. You cannot knock people out just by thinking about it. How absurd. Besides, the soldiers here are the Alliance’s elite, I’ll have you know. They are both physically and mentally strong. They would never fall from just—”

Suimei’s red eyes pointed an extremely bored, cold gaze at Weitzer and interrupted him.

“What’re you saying? These are just normal men who know a thing or two about using swords, right? What makes you think guys like that stood a chance against my will?”

Right after he fired off those words, Rumeya felt like the air in the area cooled down considerably. Had he done something? Or was she just imagining it after hearing his chilling words? No, something more than the cold night breeze was blowing through. It felt like it stuck to her, prickling at her skin.

Intimidated by Suimei’s auspicious speech and eerie aura, most of the remaining guards ran away. But it was already too late. They all collapsed to the ground as they tried to flee. From what Rumeya could see, it didn’t seem like their spirits had been drained or anything.

 There was certainly a bizarre atmosphere cloaking the area, but it didn’t seem to be what was knocking out the robust palace guards either. Was it really just as he said? That they were falling simply because he willed it?

“You bastard...” Weitzer practically hissed.

“The rest of you who are left, get out of the way. A 
simple human has no way of winning against a magician, you know?”

As Suimei made his exasperated declaration, Weitzer seemed to realize something. A confident smirk crossed his lips.

“But it seems your powers have no effect on us.”

“Sure enough. We’re still standing, ain’t we?”

Even Gaius wore a fearless smile as he backed up his companion. It was true that they were the cornerstone of their side in this battle where their subordinates were dropping like flies. 

So why was it that they were unable to sense the danger before them? Rumeya couldn’t figure it out. If she were in their position, between the ominous happenings in their surroundings Suimei’s own eerie aura, she would tuck her tails and run away immediately. 

The tides were already in Suimei’s favor, and it didn’t seem like anything they could do would change that now.
For in the dim moonlight, Suimei’s figure fell into darkness. It was as if he was a natural denizen of shadow. Night itself clung to him, cloaking his figure.

“Weitzer! Gaius!”

Suddenly, a woman’s voice rang out from behind Rumeya. It was gentle, and carried with it great concern for her friends. It was a beautiful, dulcet voice, and a woman with an equally beautiful appearance arrived in short order. 

She had long, flowing hair and strong-willed green eyes. And above all else, she wielded a terrifying sword. This was the hero of the Alliance.

“Hatsumi?!” exclaimed Gaius.

“Hero-dono!” shouted Weitzer.

“This is... Huh?”

As Hatsumi went running towards her companions, she caught sight of the terrible spectacle that lay before her. After observing the bodies on the ground in utter bafflement, she looked sternly at Suimei.

“Did you do this?”

“Yeah, but there’s no need to worry. They’re only unconscious. There’s nothing wrong with them other than that.”

A dangerous tension seemed to be building up between the two of them. Based on Suimei’s story, they were supposed to be childhood friends, but judging from Hatsumi’s attitude, that didn’t seem to be the case at all. Had something happened?

Following shortly after Hatsumi, the mage from the self-governed state, Selphy Fittney, also arrived on the scene.
“With this, all four of us have gathered!” she called.
Indeed, all of the hero’s companions now rallied to her side. Meanwhile, Suimei was still quietly trying to get through to Hatsumi.

“Hatsumi, I want you to listen to me.”

“If you obediently turn yourself in, I’ll consider 
listening to you.”

“I’m not into that kinda stuff...”

He knew he couldn’t comply with what Hatsumi was asking. It likely wouldn’t work out well for him. After all, there was no way the royal family of Miazen would treat him courteously after all this commotion.

 A bit stumped as to how to handle this increasingly complicated situation, Suimei looked imploringly at Hatsumi. Seeing this, Gaius turned to her as well.

“He’s been sayin’ it for a while, but is he really an acquaintance of yours?”

“I don’t know him, but he claims to be my childhood friend.”

“Wuh?”

Gaius raised a questioning voice in a near comical fashion. He then turned his astonished gaze on Suimei.

“Hey, lad. If you’re gonna lie, at least try a little harder, will ya? No matter how much you wanna meet the hero, not even some little brat would use that kinda excuse, y’know?”

“Sure, but your outright dismissal of what I’m trying to tell you is the real problem here. Hatsumi has amnesia, right? So not any single one of you can know for sure that what I’m saying is a lie. You follow?”

“Oh, come on. Claimin’ to be the childhood friend of a summoned hero is just li’l farfetched, doncha think?”

Gaius didn’t hesitate in making his position on the matter clear, but Suimei pushed no further. Rather than objecting, he simply let out a heavy sigh. It felt like he was talking to immovable statues. It was Selphy who questioned him next.

“So, what will you do now? Will you obediently turn yourself in?”

“I already refused that, didn’t I?”

“Shall I interpret that as intent to resist?”

“...”

Receiving no reply, Selphy tried a different approach. Something a little more threatening.

“Then let me ask you this: do you really think that you can win against us? You do know the four of us broke the demon army and defeated a demon general, don’t you?”

“That’s why you think you’re strong? That’s a bit conceited, isn’t it?”

“Care to test us then, lad?” said Gaius, jumping in.
Despite his joking tone, this was no joking matter. If Suimei resisted, this would turn into a serious fight. But, contrary to all expectations, Suimei merely turned around.

“Uh...”

“No thanks. I’m not interested. I’ll be going for now.”

“Huh?! Wait, you’re gonna run away after all that talk?!”

“I’m not interested in needlessly causing a mess. I’ll come again, so do excuse me for tonight.”

Suimei looked back over his shoulder and spoke politely. He couldn’t do what they were asking, but this would be his own way of quietly backing down. 

Perhaps because his childhood friend was present, he didn’t want to resort to violence. But Gaius quickly sprang into action.

“You think I’m gonna just say ‘yeah, okay’ now?!”

Unleashing his fighting spirit, Gaius leaped forward with a magnificent punch. His feet gouged the earth below as he kicked off the ground, and his fist flew out in front of him with a tremendous amount of power that shook the very air around it. If a blow like that caught Suimei, his dainty body would be in for a world of hurt. But Gaius’s attack was reckless.

“Hmph. Compared to my father, your fists are far too slow.”

With a snort and an exasperated comment, Suimei took a step towards Gaius in one swift, fluid motion. His right foot—the one he’d stepped forward with—dug into the ground with more power than when Gaius had launched himself. The ground practically shattered underneath him. 

He then lowered his waist and ejected his fist upward. A loud noise resonated through Gaius’s abdomen. The impact reverberated through him to the earth below, kicking up dirt. Rumeya felt like she could see a green magic circle coiling around Suimei’s extended right arm and hand. But even more stunned than she was... was Gaius himself.

“What... the...”

He couldn’t even begin to believe that a mage might beat him at his own game. Roaring over his surprised gasping, Suimei let out a shout that filled the courtyard.

“HAH!”

Putting the martial arts instructor to shame, Suimei drove his fist further into Gaius’s abdominal muscles. Even the air trembled with a shockwave from the blow, and Gaius’s body was blown clear across the courtyard, smashing into the wall on the opposite side. There was the unmistakable sound of the collision, followed by the sound of something heavy hitting the ground.

“Ridiculous...”

“You’re kidding! Gaius!”

Selphy and Hatsumi’s disbelieving cries rang out across the courtyard. Though he didn’t raise his voice, Prince Weitzer was also staring on in shock. Other than that, all was still. 

The only signs left of the encounter were the fractured earth that made it look as though there had been an explosion, the remnants of Suimei’s mana lingering in the air, and the silhouette of his fist extended outward. Rumeya could hear him exhale profoundly, but like before, his face was too concealed by his bangs for her to clearly see his expression. She could only guess it was calm. 
Before long, he stood back up and addressed his opponent.

“Yo, geezer. You alive over there?”

“You... ain’t really... a mage... are you?”

“I’m a magician. It was just a mistake to think I couldn’t engage in close combat.”

Suimei stood his ground fearlessly, but it became clear he had no intention of going any further than necessary.
 After his short exchange with Gaius, everyone else seemed to regain their composure. The mage from the self-governed state, Selphy, then began to move.

“Selphy!” Hatsumi called after her.

“Hatsumi, please step back. I will corner this man with offensive magic.”

“What? But...”

“Hero-dono, this way,” offered Weitzer.

It seemed Selphy was worried Hatsumi would get caught in the crossfire. But she stood there dumbfounded when she heard Selphy say she intended to use offensive magic. That was where Weitzer stepped in and escorted her to the rear line. The mage known as Snowstorm, Selphy Fittney, then stepped forward brimming with mana.

“Like I’ve been saying...”

“And after all this, do you really think you’ll get off so easily?”

“Hahh... But you guys started it, didn’t you?”

Suimei couldn’t help sighing. But he didn’t move. Even though Selphy was steadily approaching, he only sluggishly turned to face her. He wasn’t gathering his mana, chanting a spell, fleeing, or even preparing his defenses. On the other hand, Selphy pointed her large staff directly at him.

“Oh Wind! Thou art the power of eternity. Become a circle...”

As she began to chant, the jewel installed at the tip of her darkwood staff began to shine.

“The turbulent tyrant, right?” remarked Suimei. “Hmm? Seems the scale is quite large too.”

Just from the opening of the chant, it seemed he had grasped not only the spell, but also its magnitude. He sighed a little, a bit impressed, but still didn’t move. Was he just slow? Or... perhaps he just felt he had no reason to hurry?

“The circle of tyranny. The uncountable destruction born from the air, rush towards my enemy with your righteousness. Loud Tyrant!”

Once Selphy uttered the keywords, vortices of wind spiraled up from nothingness with her at their center. They raged and swirled in place, unmoving aside from their spinning. There were ten... no, twenty of them. Their numbers continued to grow, and then all at once, they rushed towards Suimei with a roar.

But at that moment, he began to mumble something and held up his hand. Several red lights shot out in front of him like strings. Bending at right angles, the lights turned here and there, piercing through the whirlwinds at frightening speed. By the time they were closing in on Selphy, the whirlwinds had died down so dramatically that there was hardly a breeze in the air.

“Wha—Ugh!”

Selphy’s surprise was interrupted by a gasp of anguish. It seemed the pain she was suddenly in far overrode the astonishment of seeing her spell negated. Seeing this, Suimei spoke up.

“You should be a little more wary of having your spells turned. If you don’t have proper countermeasures in place, this is what happens.”

“Wh-What... did you do?!”

“I simply unraveled the spell. I’ve seen it before, I have to say. So the reason you’re in pain right now is because, before you could fully manifest the spell, I forcefully cancelled it.”

As he spoke, Suimei raised his right arm over his head. With that, the loose pieces of earth he’d shattered in defeating Gaius suddenly rocketed into the sky. And it didn’t stop there; anything that was lying around on the ground was sucked upward as well. 

Quite a large quantity of debris gathered in the air that was now coiling into a whirlwind. Once it was fully formed, it hurled the odds and ends it had collected at Selphy with a vengeance.

“Urgh... Oh Wind. Thou shalt become a firm shield to protect me. Repel everything with your raging winds. Vortex Blockade.”

Selphy calmly chanted a defensive spell. Wind from all directions formed a vortex before her, which repelled and scattered the incoming debris.

“You cast magic without chanting?!” she gasped.

“That just now? You could barely call that magic... I mean, all I did was lift up some dirt. You could do the same thing with a bulldozer or a power shovel.”

Rumeya couldn’t understand the last few words he used, but she could tell from his tone that he was implying what he’d done was nothing special. The fighting had come to a halt for the moment, yet Suimei still didn’t move from where he stood. 

He’d already defeated Gaius. And Rumeya had heard that when he got serious, he could unleash a string of attacks one after the other. But perhaps he simply wasn’t interested or engaged right now. He merely stood there waiting. Selphy, on the other hand, seemed to have no intention of giving up.

“You leave me no choice. It’s time to get serious.”

“Listen. If you take this further, then it’ll only cause more trouble for— Okay, she’s not even listening.”

“Oh Wind. Thou art the evil gale that carries the kiss of the frozen glacier. Blow violently, grow strong, and trap my enemy within your superb cage. No one and nothing escapes your icy prison, a baptism of the snowstorm. Ephemeral Razing!”

This was the spell that had earned her the title “Snowstorm.” When she used it, a hostile storm of snow and ice took the form or a whirling gyre. As it swirled around Suimei, he stood there like it was perfectly natural. It then closed in on him, forming a massive prison of ice, snow, and wind. All that was visible within it was a blanket of pure white.

“It’s over,” Selphy declared coldly.

“Wait, Selphy! This is going too far!”

“There is nothing to worry about, Hatsumi. I held back enough that he shouldn’t die.”

“B-But...”

“When the snowstorm clears, he will just be incapacitated. All that’s left is to capture him.”

Selphy had declared that this was the end. Rumeya even saw for herself that Suimei was engulfed in Selphy’s blizzard, but... what was this cold sweat still running down her back? And answering her doubts, a faint voice came from the heart of the malevolent storm.

“O flammae, legito. Pro venefici doloris clamore...”

[Oh flames, assemble. Like the cry of the magician’s resentment...]

“?!”

“No way! He shouldn’t even be able to move his mouth in those temperatures!”

Hatsumi turned and stared at the icy prison in surprise while Selphy let out a confounded shout, but the chanting didn’t stop there.

“Parito colluctatione et aestuato. Deferto impedimentum fatum atrox.”

[Give form to death’s agony and burst into flames. Bestow the one who obstructs me with a dreadful destiny.]

Multiple red magic circles began forming in the air around the prison. In the center of them all was a particularly large one that seemed to be hovering right over where Suimei should be standing. Before long, Rumeya could spot a silhouette deep within the snowstorm. It was faint, but within its grasp was a bright flame.

“Conluceto. O Ashurbanipalis fulgidus lapillus.”

[Shine. Oh Ashurbanipal’s dazzling gem.]

The next thing anyone knew, there was an explosion. Flames burst out of the smaller magic circles, and a large, 
bright red pillar of flame erupted from the bigger magic circle that was now revolving at high speed. 

The moment the smaller fires met the larger one, they reacted to each other and detonated into a massive conflagration that blew away the white snowstorm and dyed the night sky scarlet in its stead.

The wave of heat that surged forth in the aftermath swamped all who were present, including the hero, her companions, and Rumeya. But the man who’d authored it was restraining it. The fierce wind and inferno that should have accompanied the explosion decayed into nothing more than a warm breeze by his hand.

As the crimson mist cleared away, standing there as if nothing happened... was none other than Suimei. The ground at his feet was bubbling like it was boiling. It looked as though he was standing atop a sea of molten iron. And the very sight of him, completely unfazed despite being at the epicenter of an explosion that the very earth had been unable to endure without melting, could only be described as terrifying.

“Ugh...!”

Selphy let out an unpleasant groan as she realized the magic that was her life’s work had been blown away with but a single spell. In response, Suimei addressed her in what sounded like an admiring tone.

“You’re called Selphy, right? You’re a pretty capable mage, aren’t you? The mana loaded into that spell was impressive, and its destructive power was considerable. It even restrains your target and prevents them from chanting. Out of all the mages I’ve met here so far, you’re really something.”

“...Is that supposed to be a compliment?”

“It’s a matter of perspective. You’re nothing compared to Menia as she is now or that dangerous princess from the Empire. You’ve still got a long way to go before you catch up to us...”

As Suimei uttered those last few words, he already seemed to be playing his next hand. The next thing anyone knew, the bodies of the fallen guards were stirring... but not on their own.

“Wha—”

Before Selphy could even question what was going on, the bodies of the guards were lifted up into the air and hurled at her. But these were all men she knew—her allies. That dulled her judgment. The few extra seconds she spent trying to decide how to stave off her unconscious allies proved to be fatal.

Choosing to evade instead of using magic, all she could do was throw herself to the ground. She dove to the side in an attempt to roll away. She dodged one body, then a second. Her actions weren’t particularly graceful or dexterous, but she was still able to outmaneuver the slow-moving bodies.

“Did you think such an attack would be able to defeat—”

“Nah, not at all. But this isn’t an attack.”

“What...?”

After continual dodging, Selphy made it all the way to Suimei’s right flank. But little did she realize she was now exactly where he wanted her. Suimei thrust out his right hand in her direction, his thumb and middle finger pressed together.

 It was like he’d guided her there, expected her to be there—he didn’t even have to look. And then, just like that, a snap rang out in the nighttime courtyard. With it, the air in front of Selphy’s eyes exploded. Perhaps from the concussive force of it, she immediately collapsed on the spot, seemingly unconscious.

“Selphy...”

Seeing her trusted companion utterly defeated, Hatsumi gasped. She was seized by the surprise for a brief moment, but then turned a sharp gaze on Suimei and stepped forward. Seeing her raise her sword against him, the cold expression Suimei had been wearing suddenly turned bitter.

“I said that I don’t want to fight you.”

As if weighed down by a difficult problem, Suimei put his hand to his brow and grimaced. With no empathy for his desire to protect a childhood friend, Hatsumi spoke to him in a challenging, angry tone.

“Did you think I’d stay quiet after my companions were defeated?”

“That just now? That was self-defense. They were the ones that came after me, and they weren’t playing around. I was just trying to leave, you know?”

“That’s... But...”

She seemed to understand where he was coming from. Perhaps she did have a little bit of sympathy for him, but that was overruled by her indignation for her fallen companions, and she once more turned a critical eye on him. Suimei couldn’t stand it anymore. His troubled expression turned stern, like he was rebuking an unreasonable child.

“So what? You’re gonna kill me? That sword you’re wielding right now doesn’t have a hint of righteousness in it and you know it. If Instructor Kiyoshiro saw you wielding a sword in direct opposition to the Kuchiba School’s teachings, you’d be punished immediately, you know?”

“What...? But I...”

“Are you going to use amnesia as an excuse? Stop it. The Hatsumi I know isn’t that kind of girl.”

Was she overwhelmed by Suimei, or was it that part of her realized he was right? Hatsumi’s face distorted like she was in pain. At some point, she even relaxed her fighting stance. When she did, Weitzer stepped between her and Suimei.

“Silence, you. A mere intruder has no right to instigate Hero-dono.”

“If the third wheel would kindly stay out of this...”
Suimei’s strict attitude crumbled slightly as he sighed in exasperation, but not a moment later, he turned a sharp gaze on the prince of Miazen. Anyone could tell by looking that things were about to get prickly again. If there were ever a time to get out, this seemed like it. Judging that it was the perfect opportunity, Rumeya leaped out from the group of remaining guards.

“Coming through!”

“Who— Ugh!”

She ran in in a flash, swinging her sword to keep Weitzer at bay. As she expected, he moved back accordingly, and Rumeya then took up a position at Suimei’s side like she too stood in opposition to the hero and the others.

“You’re no palace guard! Are you that bastard’s companion?!” Weitzer demanded angrily.

“Gee, I wonder.”

“What?!”

Rumeya shrugged her shoulders as she teased Weitzer. She then turned her attention to Suimei.

“Hey... Huh?”

He looked back at her in bewilderment, apparently realizing her true identity. He looked as though he intended to ask what on earth she was doing in the courtyard, but she cut straight to the matter at hand.

“Step aside, Suimei. I’ll buy you five seconds and not a moment longer. While I hold them back, you get up on the roof and then pull me up. You can do that, right?”

“...Got it.”

As Suimei nodded, Weitzer lunged towards them. It seemed he intended to give them no quarter.

“You think I’ll let you get away with that?!”

With an angry roar, he skillfully lashed out with his sword. It seemed he was quite worthy of his title as one of the Seven Swords... yet there was something strange about his attack. He only wielded one sword, but after a moment, the lines drawn in the air by his blade multiplied as it closed in. 

Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal slashes poured in from all directions. A normal swordsman wouldn’t even have time to kiss their shoulders goodbye before their head was separated from their torso, but Rumeya was no ordinary opponent. Not only did she have forty years on Weitzer, she was also one of the Seven Swords.

“My, what an aggressive attack... Hup! Not so fast! Hyah!”

With lighthearted battle cries like she was having fun, Rumeya carefully parried each of his strikes. And then, intending to pay him back with exact change, she returned the same number of blows.

“Ugh! Such an underhanded sword style!”

“I’ll take that as a compliment coming from the man they call the Cloud of Death. But now it’s my turn... HAAAAAH!”

Unleashing her fighting spirit, the aura about Rumeya changed. She’d been handling her sword with a great deal of finesse, but she now used her physical prowess as a therianthrope to launch a single, straightforward attack. Not even the man known as the Cloud of Death was able to parry such a powerful, direct blow, but he had to try. His sword drew a blue arc in the air and landed exactly where Rumeya pictured it would in her mind.

“Ridiculous... Bastard, just who are you?”

Weitzer couldn’t conceal his surprise at having his sword flicked away by a mere soldier. Unable to believe what he’d just seen with his own eyes, he looked between his sword—which had been flung some distance away—and Rumeya in disbelief. But then a voice came from above. Looking up, he could see Suimei’s silhouette on the roof backlit by the moon.

“I’m pulling you up now.”

“I’m in your hands—literally.”

After giving a casual reply, Rumeya’s body began floating upward. It was like an invisible rope was pulling her towards the roof.

“Wait!” Weitzer shouted after her.
Rumeya simply pretended not to hear him, and climbed up onto the roof when she made it. She and Suimei quickly made to leave, but Suimei stopped and looked back down at Hatsumi in the courtyard.

“Hatsumi, I will come back. But don’t try to kill next time, okay?”

“I...”

“See ya.”

After giving his somewhat concerned farewell, Suimei jumped to the next rooftop over. Rumeya followed swiftly after. As the two of them were running along the sloped roof, Suimei glanced over at Rumeya.

“Rumeya-san, you have my gratitude for your assistance... But what are you doing here?”

“Nothing much. I heard you were going to infiltrate the palace. It sounded amusing, so I came to watch.”

“...Are you making fun of me?”

“Think of it as babysitting. It wouldn’t sound good to just call it spectating.”

“But... didn’t you just admit that’s what you were doing?”

Suimei grimaced and sighed in astonishment. He couldn’t help it. This was just a drop in the bucket of ridiculousness that had been dumped on him over the years. And Rumeya had caught a glimpse of that tonight.

“Honestly, I thought you’d screwed things up... But to think it was amnesia...”

“Yeah, I was careless. Not even I expected this.”

“So, what will you do from here? Finding out she doesn’t have her memories doesn’t give you the answer you wanted, does it? I’d imagine that would only make you more worried.”

“Yeah. But really, the same as before, the only thing I can do is talk to her. There’s something else that I’m curious about, though. I’m thinking of investigating that before coming back here.”

“I don’t think you’ll find it so easy to get in again...”

Rumeya was issuing him a friendly warning, but Suimei seemed to think nothing of it.

“Probably not. But none of them seem capable of handling a magician, either. If all they do is increase the guard, then infiltrating again won’t be but so difficult.”

“My, what confidence... Well, after seeing how you fight, I don’t really have any argument.”

“It’s not like I can really fail at sneaking in here when they don’t have a single trap in place,” he said, trying to suggest it wasn’t really a matter of pride. He then quietly added, “My father’s probably rolling in his grave...”

Before exiting the castle grounds, Suimei turned back towards the courtyard one last time with a longing, regretful look on his face.

“She’s still on your mind, is she? Is she really just a friend of yours?”

“Is that weird?”

“Well, it’s not like I don’t understand a good friendship. But she seems to be a little more important to you than that. And if she’s not your special someone, then I have to admit I’m a bit curious as to what she really is to you.”

Hearing that she was simply curious, Suimei made a complex expression and decided to explain.

“Hatsumi... is my cousin.”

“So she’s family? I see... Well in that case, it’s normal to worry, huh?”

“Yeah...”

Rumeya watched Suimei. Seeing his downcast expression, he didn’t at all appear to be the young, energetic boy he was when he first visited her office. No, there was a shadow behind those sorrowful eyes now. To her, He looked more like an old soldier who’d lost his hometown. And she wasn’t too far off the mark; Suimei was indeed staring down the possibility of never returning home again. But she shook off such dark thoughts and called out to him once more.

“Hey.”

“Yeah?”

“Aren’t you... living a bit too recklessly?”

Hearing her words, Suimei came to a stop and turned to look at her directly.

“Not so much so that it’s a problem. If there’s really something I want to protect, don’t I have to take a few risks here and there?”

“I... suppose you’re right. That was foolish for me of all people to ask, wasn’t it?”

As she laughed it off, Suimei leaped forward into the darkness.

★

The young man who had intruded in Hatsumi’s room went on to defeat a large number of soldiers, Gaius, and Selphy. Then an accomplice arrived to aid him, and the two of them vanished from the palace grounds into the dark of night.
There was nothing Hatsumi herself could really do after the fact, so she returned to her bedroom alone. 

From her window, she could see the courtyard below, illuminated by sconces and mana lamps. Palace guards and government officials were restlessly milling about on high alert. The night’s events were unheard of; never before had half the entire palace guard been incapacitated by a single intruder. And said intruder still managed to get away. 

The entire castle was in chaos in the aftermath. Hatsumi could hear all kinds of angry shouting and barking from her window. Nearly the entire guard would have to be called in to make up for the unconscious men, and there was still the matter of pursuing the intruder. It would be a long night for anyone who worked in the castle.
After the intruder’s escape, Gaius and Selphy quickly regained consciousness and received magical treatment. 

They seemed to be fine; the only real damage done had been to their pride. The moment he was back on his feet, Gaius ran off shouting about going to train—despite it being the middle of the night. As for Selphy, after suffering such a humiliating defeat, it seemed her self-confidence had been seriously shaken. She spent quite some time brooding that night.

As for Weitzer, who had escaped the encounter with Suimei unscathed, he went to report to the king of Miazen on what had happened. The king was famous for being a gentle man, but as one would expect, an event like this rattled even him. He severely reprimanded those in charge of palace security, and gave a strict order for defenses to be fortified.

An hour had now elapsed since the intruder had escaped, but there was still not a single report of him being found. No one, however, was all that surprised. For someone who infiltrated the well-guarded palace and handily defeated both Gaius and Selphy, lying low would be nothing. It was unlikely the guards would ever find him, and even if they did, capturing him would be nigh impossible.

Based on what Hatsumi had heard from Weitzer, the young man had toppled the palace guards without even moving. It was hardly a fight. But...

“A person from the same world...”

That was what stuck out to her the most. The young man who’d come into her room claimed that they were childhood friends. That inevitably meant they had to be from the same world. 

He very well may be someone from her past, someone who was part of those precious memories that were lost to her. But she couldn’t tell for sure. She had her doubts, certainly, but he knew her name and her sword style. 

He even seemed to know her father. And most of all, he’d looked at her with such wistful, nostalgic, and sincere eyes. But still, what if it were all just an act?

“...”

Hatsumi threw herself backwards onto her bed. Honestly speaking, she couldn’t even remember being summoned very well. When she came to, she was lying on the same bed she was now. 

All she knew was that she was somewhere unfamiliar. As she lay there in a daze, the door to the room opened. That was when she met Selphy, who immediately explained things. Apparently Selphy was the one who’d summoned her... from a different world.

But even after listening to what Selphy said, the fog inside Hatsumi’s mind wouldn’t clear. Just who was she? What kind of person was she? Unable to answer even those simple questions about herself, she was at a complete loss. The only thing that she managed to remember was her own name. 

And with only that to cling to, she broke. Weitzer was also present with Selphy at the time, but she mostly remembered Selphy’s calm, concerned face.

After that, things were dull for a time. Once she learned she couldn’t return home, aside from the meals she ate with the royal family or the walks she took with Selphy, she mostly stayed confined to her room. But then one day, news of the demons invading reached the palace.
Looking up at the ceiling, Hatsumi recalled that day clearly.

On that morning, Weitzer visited her room. Nothing about that was unusual. He came to greet her every day. Since he had his own schedule, the time of his visit wasn’t predetermined, but he showed up particularly early that day. And he brought with him absurd news. They discussed it at length, but Hatsumi particularly remembered the conversation they’d had after that.

“Hero-dono, is there anything troubling you in your daily life?”

Weitzer was seated in a chair across from her and looked quite serious. Hatsumi, however, responded with laughter.
“Nothing whatsoever. The housemaids all take very good care of me.”

“I’m glad to hear it. However, if anything does come up, please let me know immediately, Hero-dono. You are a most welcome guest of the state. There is no need to be shy. Please ask of me anything that you desire.”

“Then I’d like you to stop calling me ‘Hero-dono.’”

“What...?”

Weitzer looked astonished when she said that. He’d apparently never considered that that would be the first thing she asked for.

“That is... Um...”

Being a hero was a title of great honor, and Weitzer addressed her as such to show his respect. As royalty, there were very few people that decorum demanded he treat with such formality, so it meant something to him to be proper with the nation’s summoned hero. Realizing that she might have him between a rock and hard place, Hatsumi dropped the subject.

“I understand. The decision is yours.”

“As you wish.”

She gave him a way out, and Weitzer lightly bowed down his head. Rather than humility, he meant to show his respect. He knew that Hatsumi had trouble assuming her role as the hero. How could she with practically no knowledge of who she was? It just didn’t sit well with her. In fact, it was still bothering her even now.

“Hey, is it really true... that I’m a hero?”

It was a weighty question, but Weitzer didn’t hesitate to answer.

“But of course. Under the supervision of the Church of Salvation, we held the hero summoning ritual right here on the palace grounds. That was how you came to us. There is no mistaking it.”

“But still...”

Even if they called her a hero, what did that really mean? She knew that she’d been called here to defeat the demons, but it all felt oh-so unreal. Abstract, even. She and Weitzer both were looking for something more concrete.

“I have heard that the hero summoned by the summoning ritual receives a divine blessing from the Goddess.”

“But what does that mean? What is it specifically?”

“According to the legends, it is a power that cannot be achieved by normal means. Surely some of the tales are exaggerated, but there must be some sort of change you can feel. Something physical.”

“Hmm...”

“Nothing?”

“I mean, it’s not like I can compare how I feel now to how I felt before...”

“Surely there’s something.”

“If I had to say... I do feel like I can move around better than other people. I feel like I’m strong.”

With that, she held out her hand like she was asking Weitzer for a handshake. Taking a hint, he grasped her hand. She squeezed back.

“Th-This is...”

Weitzer looked stunned. And rightfully so—the grip she had on his hand was unlike anything a girl of her age and size should be able to produce. It was unquestionably superhuman.

 And upon realizing that, Weitzer’s eyes went even wider. This was tangible proof that she was the hero.

“This must be the power of the Goddess’s blessing...”

“Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it.”

“To us, it is a delight worth celebrating.”

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, their hero had come. To the people of this world, she was like a saint sent from the heavens. It was all quite confusing to Hatsumi, but she watched as Weitzer knit his brow. It seemed there was something else on his mind too.

“But for me, personally... I am somewhat disinclined to have you head to the battlefield.”

“...Yeah.”

It seemed that he was trying to be considerate of Hatsumi in his own way. But in the end, she could give him no encouragement or hope. Weitzer’s expression then became rather tense. It was the face he wore when he was addressing official business.

“Hero-dono, I must apologize for asking, but I would like to have you visit and observe the soldiers.”

“That’s what you were talking about yesterday, right?”

“Yes. The officers and men who are the pride of our army want to show off their training to you, Hero-dono.”

Of course, there was more to it than that. Training to show off their skills to the hero was certainly good motivation for the army, but they wanted to inspire Hatsumi as well. They were hoping to trigger something in her as the hero. The demonstration wasn’t the king’s idea, but he was pressured into arranging it by the people around him—or so Selphy said. However...

They want to show off something like that to a woman...?
It very well may work on a man, but Hatsumi had a hard time imagining something like a military demonstration would ignite anything within her. She had no will to fight whatsoever, so perhaps they were just that desperate. Of course, it was also true that they were just eager to impress their female hero.

“What about Selphy?”

“She has other business to take care of, so though it may be presumptuous, I will accompany you today.”

This was unexpected. Normally Selphy was the one accompanied Hatsumi everywhere.

“Is that alright? You’re a prince, after all. Don’t you have something else to be doing?”

Hatsumi was concerned she might be keeping him from official duties, but Weitzer shook his head.

“I’m doing precisely what I should be. It is a great honor to serve as the hero’s escort. Mind you, I think of it as a pleasure rather than an obligation.”

Weitzer made every possibly concession to make Hatsumi comfortable and put her at ease. He had his integrity, both as a prince and a gentleman.

“Thank you, Weitzer.”

“There is no need to thank me. I told you, it is both an honor and a pleasure. For you, Hero-dono, I would escort you to the ends of the earth.”

“That’s going too far...”

“No, I truly—”

Just as Weitzer began to speak, hurried footsteps could be heard out in the hallway. They approached swiftly, and stopped just outside the door to the room.

“I wonder what’s wrong...”

“It is taboo to run in the palace unless it is an emergency. Which means...”

“Something urgent has happened?”

Weitzer nodded with a grim expression and headed towards the door. By the time he reached it, there was a knocking coming from the other side. It sounded like a palace guard. Weitzer opened the door and addressed him quietly.

 Their hushed conversation lasted for a few moments, and then the guard took his leave. Weitzer approached Hatsumi again, and took a knee before her.

“Hero-dono, I apologize for the suddenness, but I will have to excuse myself for a moment.”

“Did something happen?”

“No. Nothing that should trouble our hero.”

“...I see.”

Though he spoke of it like it was no big deal, it was quite clear something had indeed happened. Hatsumi was interested, but she didn’t really want to pry. She saw Weitzer off, but even after he left, the dark expression on the guard’s face weighed heavily on her mind. 

In the end, she gave in and went after Weitzer herself.
Asking the domestics where the prince had gone, Hatsumi followed after him. Ultimately, she found herself in front of the castle audience chamber.

 She politely acknowledged the guards at the door, but then heard an angry voice coming from the other side of it. It sounded like someone was yelling, but because the door to the audience chamber was closed, she couldn’t make out what they were saying. Whatever it was, however, it didn’t sound good. She decided to ask one of the guards what was going on.

“What’s this?”

“That is... We cannot really say...”

The guard looked troubled. Realizing that he wasn’t going to answer her directly, Hatsumi stepped forward.

“Open it,” she said unflinchingly.

“B-But...! Right now is...!”

“Please.”

The guards ended up yielding and obligingly opening the door for her. As one would expect, mere porters could not refuse a request from the hero.

 Realizing the position she’d put them in, Hatsumi apologized, and then entered the audience chamber. Inside, a dark-skinned, muscular man was frantically trying to appeal to the king of Miazen.

“While we sit here and do nothing, Larsheem is being assaulted!”

“I understand. But I cannot simply deploy the army immediately just at your request.”

“I’m begging you!”

The muscular man was antsy and restless like a caged animal—like he might lunge at any moment. It seemed whatever crisis was at hand had him extremely on edge. So much so that he even dared to speak disrespectfully to the king. But perhaps because they understood the dire nature of his circumstances, nobody present in the audience chamber said anything about it. Even the king looked sympathetic, but his position demanded that he stay stern.

“Forvan-dono, I understand your plight, but do calm yourself.”

“Then...?”

It seemed the man was expecting the king to follow up in some way, but he said nothing more. Undeterred, the muscular man continued to plead his case. As he and the king talked, Hatsumi looked around the room. Among the officials and generals present, Hatsumi spotted Selphy and quietly headed over to her.

“Hatsumi?! What are you doing here?!”

“Weitzer was visiting me, but had to leave suddenly when a guard came by. It piqued my interest.”

Hatsumi gave her the short of it, and Selphy looked quite taken by surprise. Before she could get in a word edgewise, Hatsumi asked her about the current situation.

“So, what’s going on Selphy?”

“...It seems that the demons have invaded Larsheem.”
“The demons...”

To the north of the Alliance was an empty belt of land that was neither demon nor human territory. The demon army had allegedly shown no signs of movement after their invasion of Noshias, but now they’d suddenly shown up in Larsheem, which lay at the northern end of the Alliance.

“It seems they were pretending to be docile when they were actually moving their troops all the way to the Alliance.”

“And... who is that man?”

“He’s one of the officers from Larsheem. With just the soldiers in Larsheem and the support they have from neighboring countries, they won’t make it. Which is why this man came to Miazen seeking aid.”

“It looks like the king isn’t considering his request favorably...”

Selphy returned a nod. The man earnestly pleaded with the king over and over, but it seemed the king was only placating him. Hatsumi had to wonder why.

“The Saadias Alliance was formed by the countries in the north to support each other, no? It’s not just an alliance in name. So it really alright not to send help at a time like this?”

“It’s just as you say. In the case that one country of the Alliance falls into crisis, the others are indeed meant to help. Alas, an army is not something that can be moved quickly.”

“I see...”

Selphy meant to say that was the real problem here. Larsheem needed immediate help, but getting a large, organized force there would take some time. Yet even so, the man still cried for Miazen’s aid. Quite contrary to his emotional roaring, Weitzer spoke to him in a calm, composed, and rational manner. 

But the answer didn’t change. There was nothing that could be done instantaneously. Nevertheless, it didn’t stop the man from asking—from trying. He was literally begging them to save his country. And it was a pitiful, desperate sight. 

The man was covered in injuries and bandages nearly from head to toe. He’d likely been fighting himself before coming to Miazen.

“Ah...”

Suddenly, the king and officials turned towards Hatsumi. She knew they were looking to her for help—for hope. But they quickly looked away. Based on what she’d done—or hadn’t—before now, they all likely thought of her as unreliable.

The man continued to plead with the king. The palace guards attempted to pull him away, but he was far too large and muscular for them to be able to restrain him. He shouted out in desperate defiance as they tried to force him to withdraw.

“Hngh...”

His roaring cry jolted Hatsumi. It felt like he was yelling directly inside her head. It echoed and reverberated in her skull like a clock tower bell. Then she saw something. Something strange.

“What...?”

As if she had vertigo, Hatsumi’s field of vision began to spin and shift. All she could see now was a gray backdrop through a black sandstorm. Before she knew it, she’d lost her sense of peripheral vision and could only see what was dead ahead of her. It was like watching a television. And then, just as suddenly as it had come, the sandstorm vanished like white noise when someone changed the channel.

But things weren’t back to normal just yet. What she saw next wasn’t the emotional scene unfolding in the audience chamber, but what looked like some kind of funeral service. Unable to move anything but her eyes, all she could do was watch.

It was a Western-style funeral, and there were both Japanese and foreigners in attendance. It was a big, diverse group, but everyone was dressed in all black. The deceased would be dearly missed, that much was certain. Hatsumi just didn’t know who it was.

But there was one face she did recognize. The boy reading a eulogy before the crowd of mourners looked like an older version of the boy she’d seen many times in her dreams. And it seemed the biggest loss was his. As he read, she could hear him say things like “father” and “only family.” He must have been in the throes of grief. There were hardly words to express the anguish of being alone in the world at such a young age.

But even so, he only looked ahead. Since he would be walking forward alone from here on out, he couldn’t afford to hang his head. He read his father’s eulogy stoutly without even a sign of letting tears or woe stop him. His resolute black eyes stared into the gray, cloudy distance. Then the channel suddenly seemed to change again and Hatsumi was seeing the living room of some house. The same boy was there, muttering something in his sleep.

“I... must keep going forward in order to realize the dream my father preached to me... without fail. If I stop, it will end right here. That’s why... I have to go save them.”

Perhaps that was why he hadn’t shown an ounce of weakness while everyone else was mourning. But after subconsciously affirming his resolve, he quietly fell into a deep slumber. The funeral, the service, meeting with everyone who’d come to pay their respects... 

All of it must have been exhausting. But now, peering at his sleeping face, Hatsumi could see a single tear streaming down his cheek.
Was this vision a flashback of one of her missing memories? The screen of her mind briefly returned to the black sandstorm before cutting back to reality. She could once again hear the angry shouting of the man from Larsheem, and she could make out Weitzer standing in front of him. It was the same scene as before.

“Ah...”

“Are you alright, Hatsumi? What’s the matter?” Selphy asked.

“Y-Yeah... I’m alright.”

Selphy seemed concerned, likely because Hatsumi looked dazed. But Hatsumi could tell based on the conversation Weitzer was having with the man that she’d only been out of it for a split second. But that was all it took. Within that split second, Hatsumi had made up her mind. Stepping away from Selphy, she walked over to Weitzer and the man from Larsheem.

“I’ll go.”

“Huh? Who the hell are you?”

The man looked quite puzzled at a young girl suddenly cutting into the conversation. But so did Weitzer, who inadvertently revealed her identity in a cry of surprise.

“Hero-dono?!”

“Wait, you’re the hero?”

“Yes. My name is Kuchiba Hatsumi, and I seem to be the hero summoned by the Alliance.”

At that, the man sneered and snorted.

“Oh yeah? I heard the summoned hero was a coward who wouldn’t raise a hand against a fly after being summoned.”

“You bastard! You will mind your manners in front of the hero!” Weitzer immediately reprimanded him.

“Ha! It’s the truth, ain’t it? If it wasn’t, then there’s no way she’d be sittin’ in here with what’s happening out there.”

“Th-That’s... There are extenuating circumstances...” 
Weitzer said, his voice shrinking.

“Yeah, they call that cowardice.”

That much was undeniable. Even though she’d been the victim of some very bizarre events, it was true she’d done nothing. She was simply hiding away while she waited for the pleasantries to end. It was the opposite of what that boy had done. He’d kept his chin up and stared his future right in the eye, no matter how grim or scary it was. If he could see her now, he’d surely call her a coward too.
Hatsumi looked at the man from Larsheem and met his derisive gaze.

“What? You got something to say?”

“I do. Whether I can fight or not... Would you like to test that right now?”

“Hatsumi?!”

“Hero-dono?!”

“You little punk...”

Selphy and Weitzer both looked on the verge of panic, but the man bared his fangs. After coming here straight from the battlefield and getting into it with the king, it seemed he was raring to go.

The man forcefully shook off the palace guards still trying to restrain him. They were hardly a match for him, and were flung this way and that. Hatsumi started to walk towards them at a good clip... and deftly drew the sword hanging at Weitzer’s waist. She then took a stance in front of the man from Larsheem, the tip of her sword pointed upward at his eyes. It seemed that was all it took to summon her knowledge of swordsmanship.

“What?! My sword is—”

Hatsumi could hear Weitzer’s belated reaction. It was only after seeing it flicker in the mana lamps of the audience chamber that he realized his sword was in her hands. He still had no idea how it had gotten there, however.

As such, there was absolutely nothing he could have done to stop her. The man before her, who’d seen it all happen in the blink of an eye, was also completely bewildered. Seeing that he had no intention of assuming a stance to fight her, Hatsumi made her move. 

She lunged at his chest, closing the distance between them in a flash. The man could only stare wide-eyed as she came at him.
However, her blade never reached him. It only sliced through the air next to him. It seemed that, though she was initially coming at his chest, she’d taken a step to the right as she leaped.

“Is this sufficient?” she asked.

The man gritted his teeth, vexed he hadn’t been able to see through her.

“You sayin’ I would’ve died from that just now? As expected of a hero, but—”

Was he trying to offer her some candid advice, perhaps? He didn’t get to finish. In the middle of his sentence, a heavy boom rang out behind him. Just over his shoulder, the stone pillars that held up decorative flags near the entrance to the audience chamber collapsed to the ground. It looked as though they’d been split clean in half. Watching them crumble, the name of the technique she’d just used came to Hatsumi’s mind.

“The Phantom Sword of the Kurikara Dharani’s ‘Long Sword of the Absolute Edge.’”

Everyone in the chamber was at a loss for words over what had just happened. Two stone pillars—both of which were well outside of Hatsumi’s reach—were toppled without her ever touching them. Their surprise was perfectly understandable.

“Th-The pillars!”

“Impossible! From that one swing...?!”

She could hear disbelief worm its way through the crowd. Hatsumi then turned a rather casual question on the startled spectators... who had apparently quite misunderstood what had just happened.

“Those are the monsters that I must defeat, correct?”

Just then, there was the sound of something else crumbling to the floor. When everyone turned once more to look in the direction of the pillars, they now saw a grotesque figure that had been cut into pieces. It was an ugly creature, like an abomination straight from a fantasy story—except this one was very, vividly real. It had horns, and both its skin and the blood flowing out of it were red. Its white, dead eyes were rolled back into its skull.

“A demon?!” Weitzer exclaimed.

“To think they would have spies all the way over here...” the man from Larsheem said bitterly, irritated at his own negligence.

“When did you realize?” Weitzer asked, turning to Hatsumi.
“As soon as I took hold of the sword. Your senses also sharpen with a sword in your hand, don’t they, Weitzer?”
“That’s true, but...”

Even so, it was a little extreme. As Weitzer reconciled with his own bewilderment, Hatsumi turned to the man from Larsheem.

“So, are you still unsatisfied with my abilities?”

“...No. I’m honestly amazed, Hero-sama. I had no idea. I completely take back everything I said earlier.”

All the hostility he’d been carrying with him vanished with a sigh. Hatsumi then turned back to Weitzer, who was still standing there in a daze. She carefully held out his sword to him, pommel first, with an apologetic expression on her face.

“Sorry for taking it without asking.”

“No, Hero-dono! Not at all! Your skill with it is magnificent— No, divine! I am completely humbled.”

“Calling it divine is going a little too far...”

“Certainly not! To be able to cut such a large stone pillar in a single swing without magic... Such a feat is ordinarily impossible.”

Weitzer was uncommonly excited, and Hatsumi replied nearly without thinking.

“What are you saying? A swordsman who can only cut things within their range is...”

“Oh?”

“Huh? Oh...!”

It was almost like her mouth was moving on its own. She hardly knew what she was saying, so she clammed up before she said anything she might regret. Since she’d cut herself off in the middle of sentence, however, Weitzer looked at her curiously.

“Is something the matter?”

“N-No, nothing. Anyway...”

Hatsumi briefly retreated into her head to contemplate things. Was it really alright for her to step into this battle? Was it the right choice? They were difficult questions, but then she recalled the words of the boy in her dream. She had her answer.

“Where are the people that need to be saved?”

Her bold words echoed through the audience chamber, stunning all who were present into silence. That was the beginning of the fighting for Kuchiba Hatsumi, the girl who’d lost her past.

It was remembering the boy in her dream that gave her the courage to look up and move forward. She had to. In order for her to keep her head held high when she finally saw him next, she had to follow in his footsteps. She had to keep going.

And reflecting on that now, as she lay on her bed after the night’s incidents, she came to a certain realization.
“I see... It was what he said...”

The reason the boy who’d intruded in her room made her feel somewhat nostalgic was because he spoke the same way the boy in her dreams did.

★

Currently, Suimei and the others were gathering for a light meal at a restaurant that was something like a tea house, but not everyone was present. It was only Suimei, Felmenia, and Lefille so far. Liliana was running late and hadn’t made it yet.

“So, how are things going on your end?” Suimei asked, turning to Felmenia who was sitting next to him.
“There... wasn’t any particularly useful information,” she replied meekly.

“Figured as much. I wasn’t really expecting anything to crop up after just a couple of days...”
Hearing this, Lefille knit her brow and joined the conversation.

“I also didn’t hear anything about a trespasser infiltrating the palace. They all want to talk about the hero, but it’s the same old thing.”

The day after Suimei snuck into Calnus Palace, he’d asked Felmenia and the others help him with gathering information regarding not just Hatsumi, but also affairs in Miazen more generally. To confirm Hatsumi’s situation, Suimei knew he’d have to sneak back into the palace, but he wanted to learn as much as he could before then.
The night he’d seen Hatsumi, she mentioned that she had amnesia. So one of the first things he tried to investigate was how that might have happened and if was indeed really amnesia. 

He and the girls had spent two or three days now trying to get to the bottom of it, but in the end, they hadn’t come up with anything useful in their scouring. It was almost like there was a gag order surrounding information involving the hero. Everyone they talked to about her would only say that she was beautiful, talented with a sword, or some other generic fact; none of it was useful. Hearing that Felmenia and Lefille had come to the same dead end he had, Suimei limply put his chin on the table and sighed.

“To think we wouldn’t hear anything at all...”

“Indeed. Usually there’s at least someone with gossip...”

It was strange. To the people of this world, heroes were like celebrities. There was a great deal of interest about them, and under normal circumstances, the people would be clamoring to get the latest scoop on their local hero. But just as Felmenia said, there wasn’t even gossip about Hatsumi.

It was the same regarding news of the palace infiltration. It seemed the matter was being kept hush-hush. The people of the city were apparently none the wiser about it. But that much was to be expected. After all, a stranger had not only infiltrated the palace, but had gotten away. Of course the palace wouldn’t want word of that spreading. It was no coincidence, however, that the number of guards patrolling the city had increased over the past couple of days.

While Suimei and the girls were in the middle of talking about all this, the teahouse doorbell jingled. The three of them all turned towards the entrance, but there was no one there. At least, it didn’t look like it. But there was an unmistakable presence that had entered the building. Just as they tried to focus on it, Liliana pulled out a chair at the table and sat down.

“You made it.”

“Yes, just now. Also... the notebook you gave me was very useful.”

The emotions showing on her face were faint, but Liliana was both surprised and impressed. Before they’d split up to gather information, Suimei had given each of them a notebook filled with white paper. It seemed it had come in handy.

“How was it for you three?” Liliana asked.

“I failed to produce anything of merit. In the end, today’s search was fruitless as well.”

“Same for me.”

“I did get some people to talk to me, but... it was mostly nothing but rumors with poor credibility and stories that were erratically dramatized. Getting information from the Church of Salvation was my last resort, but it seems they don’t really know anything either. I had to give up there.”

No one really had anything to show for themselves. Except for Liliana. It seemed she’d at least gotten a taste of something.

“I also didn’t hear too much... but I did get a little something.”

“Really?” asked Suimei.

“Yes. I have it all here,” she replied with a nod.
Liliana then pulled out her notebook and began relaying what she’d learned to her companions.

“There isn’t much information going around town about the hero Hatsumi Kuchiba, which it seems you all experienced firsthand.”

“It’s strange, isn’t it?” Suimei asked.

“It is. The lack of information on the hero is outright baffling. It’s possible that the citizens have information, but are unwilling to share. But it’s particularly unusual that the Church of Salvation seems to know nothing. In general, most heroes have an attendant from the church in their retinue. At the very least, they have a contact within the church that they report to. This is largely why the church is so well-informed in regards to the heroes and their exploits. There are exceptions like Reiji-sama, however. And I believe in this case that the royal family of Miazen is monopolizing information on Hatsumi Kuchiba.”

“So it’s the state?”

“It’s probable that they don’t want the church to interfere while they use the hero to earn glory as quickly as possible. Fairly transparent, don’t you think?”

If what Liliana was suggesting was true, it would explain why Felmenia, who usually brought back solid information, had turned up emptyhanded. But as a completely separate matter entirely, Suimei couldn’t help but notice Liliana was speaking more smoothly than usual today. Normally she spoke at a tottering pace, but perhaps this was normal when she was giving a work-related report.

“Now, moving on to Hatsumi Kuchiba herself, it seems she is unable to use magic. Though I believe Suimei already knows this, she is apparently quite skilled with a blade. Her sword style is called... the Phantom Sword of the Kuru-ri-ku-kara Dhara... rarara?”

Having trouble making heads or tails 
of it, Liliana was frowning as she tilted her head from side to side.

“The Phantom Sword of the Kurikara Dharani,” said Suimei.

“Yes, that’s it. Also, as you mentioned before, Hatsumi Kuchiba may have amnesia.”

“Did you find out any of the details?”

“It seems that the soldiers who fought alongside her often heard her express concern over her lost memories to her companions. At the very least, it seems certain her memory has been compromised in some way. As you suggested before, Suimei, it may be wise to look into the possibility that she is being brainwashed... though it is difficult to imagine someone being able to do that to a hero under the Goddess’s protection.”

“Yeah. It’d be pretty hard to magically influence someone who’s protected by a power of a higher-order than magic, if you think about it.”

Liliana nodded. Looking at her, a certain doubt crossed Suimei’s mind.

“At any rate, I’m surprised the soldiers talked to you.”

“I heard the heroic tales the soldiers were telling about how they defeated the demons. Men like that are all around. And once they start getting heated up talking about it, their lips loosen on other subjects as well.”

“I see. So they just need a little riling, huh?”

“They’re also less guarded around people my age. Though I had to tolerate them reeking of liquor,” she declared flatly.

To use her own physical appearance in such a way... It seemed she was indeed a first-rate spy, even at her age. She was quite a terrifying little girl. Having heard enough on that point, however, he urged her to continue.

“Then, next is the information I obtained regarding Hatsumi Kuchiba’s companions. First off is the martial artist from Larsheem, Gaius Forvan. It seems he was a well-known man to begin with, and I’ll leave his abilities for later. Apparently when the demons invaded Larsheem not all that long ago, he came to Miazen to appeal to the king directly. The king was apparently unable to send troops right away, but Hatsumi Kuchiba offered her support, and that was the beginning of their relationship. Then there’s the mage named Selphy Fittney. She is a mysterious figure, but she was the mage brought over from the self-governed state to summon Hatsumi Kuchiba. Her specialties are wind and ice magic, earning her the title of ‘Snowstorm.’ This is just speculation on my part, but on the fragments of information I procured, I believe she may be a half-elf. The way I distinguish between an elf and a half-elf is entirely based on the Colonel’s style, but again, I’m not completely certain on this point.”

Suimei was a bit stunned. Liliana had exaggerated a bit when she said she’d gotten “a little something.” She’d practically turned into a fountain of information. Felmenia and Lefille were both listening in astonishment as well.

“Her third and final companion is Weitzer Ryerzen, the crown prince of Miazen. He is one of the Seven Swords who is also known by his title: ‘Cloud of Death.’ At last year’s Seven Sword Kings festival, he earned a reputation for defeating Princess Titania Root Astel in a fierce battle. According to the rumors, he was charmed by Hatsumi Kuchiba’s skill with a blade and has been following her around like an attendant.”

Suimei was impressed Liliana had gone as far as investigating Hatsumi’s companions.

“...So you even investigated them too, huh?”

“I believed it to be necessary.”

He should have known better. This really was about what he should have expected from a former intelligence agency operative. Suimei was belatedly beginning to understand how she’d earned her place in the Elite Twelve.

“That’s about it, right...?”

“Sound like it.”

Suimei and Felmenia assumed that had to be the end of the intelligence she’d gathered and went to move the conversation forward, but Liliana shyly spoke up again.
“No, um, there’s still more...”

“Oh, really? What else did you get?”

“Well, it’s about the state of affairs regarding palace’s security.”

“What...?”

“WUH?!”

Felmenia was surprised, but Suimei could only make some strange noise to express his shock. Lefille simply sat there in silence, stunned. She could hardly believe what Liliana had accomplished.

“L-Lily, you even gathered that kind of information?”

“Yes. That’s the most critical information... isn’t it?”

“Y-You... You’re certainly right.”

Lefille couldn’t argue there. But she, just like Suimei and Felmenia, didn’t know what else to say. They all assumed that it would be impossible to get any substantial intelligence on the palace. But lo and behold, Liliana had done it.

“As expected, after Suimei infiltrated the other day, security was tightened. During the day, the guard has increased twofold. And at night, threefold with frequent shift changes. It’s a countermeasure to prevent any suspicious persons from mixing in with the guards. The patrols around the palace have also increased across the board. At night, it also seems they’re employing a number of skilled swordsmen and mages. Though I don’t think any of them would be much of a threat for you, Suimei...”

“Well, I’ll manage one way or other on that front.”

“I’m sure. Now, regarding Hatsumi Kuchiba’s personal security... Ever since the incident, it seems she is escorted everywhere.”
