      <h1>Prologue: At the Demon Lord’s Castle</h1>

      <p>The stronghold of the demons lay at the very extremity of the northern lands. The dragonnewt Eanru had once joked about Ilzarl’s “cold meals,” but that was more truth than it was joke. The entire region was plunged into a neverending winter of intense snow and ice. It was completely inhospitable to humans—no, to all living things.</p>

      <p>In short, the land was outright hostile. It was only fitting, then, that a certain breed of hostile beings called it home. Some thought that the savage demons were simply insensible to the treacherousness of the area, but that was in fact precisely why they’d made their stronghold there. It would be nigh impossible for the humans to ever push into such perilous territory.</p>

      <p>If humans had the resilience and the mobility demons did, it would be a different story. But they were all earthbound and had no natural resistance to the elements. So in that sense, the cold northern lands really were ideal for a stronghold. And the stronghold the demons had built there was grand enough to be called a proper castle.</p>

      <p>It had stone walls, spires, ramparts, gates—the works. All eyes that beheld it would believe it to be a castle simply based on the way it looked. It was... recognizable in a strange way. It looked oh-so familiar, reminiscent of the castles of human lands, that it was almost hard to believe it belonged to demons. But that was no coincidence. Because those with humanoid figures stood at the top of the hierarchy of demons, the architecture of their stronghold was naturally catered to them.</p>

      <p>Deep within that castle in a dull and dim room, a sharp streak of light poured in from an opening door. It was a warm, orange light that cut right through the darkness—something that almost seemed out of place in a castle full of the dark power of the Evil God. But it was simply torchlight from the hall outside, which silhouetted a single shadow slipping in through the door.</p>

      <p>“Pardon me.”</p>

      <p>Courteously entering the room was a female demon wearing deep blue armor and carrying a large sword. Despite her dark skin, white hair, and red eyes, she looked perfectly human at a glance. But the constant aura of bloodthirst lingering about her betrayed her. She was anything but normal.</p>

      <p>As if they’d been anticipating her arrival, the candlesticks in the room all lit up when she set foot inside, illuminating those who were seated around the table waiting for her. The young girl with black hair and dark skin, Demon Lord Nakshatra. The man with blond bangs gloomily hanging over his face, Lishbaum. The woman with bat-like wings, Latora. The beautiful man with long, silver hair, Ilzarl. These were the players that controlled the demon world.</p>

      <p>“So we’re all finally here...”</p>

      <p>“Long time no see, darlings.”</p>

      <p>The armored female demon’s arrival was met with Ilzarl’s discontented gripe and Latora’s friendly greeting. However, she didn’t react to either one of them. She simply offered the room a glare before kneeling down before Nakshatra.</p>

      <p>“We have been waiting, Moolah.”</p>

      <p>“As have I, my lord and master. It brings me great honor and joy to have an audience with you once more.”</p>

      <p>The armored female demon—Moolah, the last of the demon generals—bowed her head deeply to Nakshatra. Nakshatra ordered her to be at ease, and she obediently moved to her place at the table with the others.</p>

      <p>“I see the number of bodies to warm these seats has decreased since we last met,” she commented indifferently.</p>

      <p>“All is as it should be. Each and every one of them who suffered defeat at the hands of mere humans was unfit to fulfill the ambitions of our god. They were too weak.”</p>

      <p>“You couldn’t be more right. They had exceptional power and protection from our god, yet still fell to humans... How dare they shame Lord Nakshatra’s sacred name like that. Those weaklings were worse than trash and lower than scum.”</p>

      <p>Moolah’s words for her fallen comrades were curt and merciless. Really, she was declaring that power was everything, and there wasn’t a soul in this world who would argue with her. They knew all too well that life was a game of rule by the strong and survival of the fittest. It was, frankly speaking, the way of the demons.</p>

      <p>“Now, what will we do about these empty seats? Leaving them vacant leaves quite a large hole...”</p>

      <p>It wasn’t good. Even Moolah understood that. The demons were beings that strove towards a single goal, and they meandered towards it like an unruly mob. That was why the guidance of the demon generals—the vanguards of the Evil God’s will—was essential. Trying to move the demon army without them would only mean chaos. If the mob were left to its own devices and the individual demons allowed to act as they pleased, they would be so disorganized that they would easily be overpowered by the weakling humans. As Moolah voiced her apprehensions, Nakshatra gave a generous nod as if she were in full agreement.</p>

      <p>“Regarding that matter, it has already been decided. Lishbaum.”</p>

      <p>As Nakshatra spoke, she exchanged glances with the single demon who served her like an adjutant. Hearing her turn the explanation over to him, Lishbaum addressed Moolah while making exaggerated gestures.</p>

      <p>“The answer we’ve arrived at is for you to take charge of several of the army corps.”</p>

      <p>“Several? I have already been entrusted with a group of pawns, as I’m sure you know. Are you saying that you plan to further increase my workload, bastard?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. We would like you to command three or four units now.”</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum, my true purpose is to protect Lord Nakshatra. Yet despite knowing that, you insist on peddling other duties upon me. Am I the only one that finds that unreasonable?”</p>

      <p>“We are shorthanded, after all.”</p>

      <p>“As the main cause of that predicament, just what are you saying?”</p>

      <p>Moolah shot a cold, piercing gaze at Lishbaum like she intended to kill him on the spot. It would be an understatement to say she saw through him. And certainly, there was something behind Lishbaum’s smile...</p>

      <p>“Oh my, so you’re onto me. Let me just say that it wasn’t a pointless expenditure. Quite the opposite—it was necessary.”</p>

      <p>Lishbaum made it sound like the entire situation had been arranged on purpose. Hearing this, Moolah’s cold stare became a fiery, ferocious one.</p>

      <p>“...Just what are you thinking? What’s your game here?”</p>

      <p>“The same as the rest of you. I wish to eradicate all life from this world. That is all.”</p>

      <p>“Does that have something to do with reducing the number of pawns?”</p>

      <p>“Yes.”</p>

      <p>When asked point-blank, Lishbaum replied without any pretense. Moolah continued to glare at him, but was unable to decipher just what the sinister light in his eyes meant. Giving up on probing any further, however, she took her seat.</p>

      <p>“...As I said before, it is my duty first and foremost to protect Lord Nakshatra. However, if Lord Nakshatra so desires it, I shall comply.”</p>

      <p>“It seems Moolah-sama is on board now as well. What do you say, my lord?”</p>

      <p>As Lishbaum turned to Nakshatra, she smiled faintly. And then...</p>

      <p>“Moolah, commander of our elite guard, we expect great things of you.”</p>

      <p>“Of course, my lord. Though I may be inadequate, I will exert myself to the fullest in your name.”</p>

      <p>“Very well. Now, are there any who object to Moolah’s promotion?”</p>

      <p>Ilzarl raised an eyebrow at Nakshatra’s question.</p>

      <p>“You’re asking us? I have no complaints about the strong taking the lead.”</p>

      <p>“I’m with Ilzarl on this one. I don’t have any complaints as long as she’s strong, and I know she is. Besides, if we’re talking about being the commander of the elite guard, she’s way more cut out for the job than we are, right, Nakshatra-sama?”</p>

      <p>Moolah was the one to respond to Latora’s frivolous answer.</p>

      <p>“Latora... As a proud demon general, how can you talk to Lord Nakshatra that way?”</p>

      <p>“What, are you angry? You know I’ve always been this way, Moolah darling.”</p>

      <p>“I am saying that you should know your place.”</p>

      <p>“After all this time? It’s fine, isn’t it, Nakshatra-sama?”</p>

      <p>“We do not mind.”</p>

      <p>When Nakshatra took Latora’s side, Moolah silently accepted it without a single sign of discontent. To Moolah, Nakshatra and her word were absolute. She would never dare go against them. And with a definitive end to that sidebar pronounced, Lishbaum once more spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Incidentally, there is something that I would like everyone to see today.”</p>

      <p>The first to react to that statement was Ilzarl.</p>

      <p>“Oh? So does this mean one of your damn schemes is coming to light?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, this.”</p>

      <p>With that, Lishbaum leaned back a little and glanced behind him. Following his gaze, the others in the room looked in the same direction, but... there was nothing there. Finding the situation suspicious, and being aware of Lishbaum’s abilities, they all observed him carefully.</p>

      <p>Slowly but surely, Lishbaum’s shadow opened up eerily, and from within it, an even larger shadow appeared. It was a figure more grotesque than anything they’d ever beheld, even among their own kind, but it was unmistakably a demon.</p>

      <p>It had several eyes stacked horizontally in an asymmetric fashion, and a single insectoid mouthpart dripping acidic saliva. It had enormous arms like a human bodybuilder, but they dangled down from bulging shoulders with distorted bones and protruding horns sticking out all over. Its skin was dark purple, and its swollen, lumpy body was massive. It looked as sturdy as it did grotesque, putting even the ugliest demons alive to shame. But its most remarkable quality by far was the amount of power from the Evil God it possessed.</p>

      <p>“Ew, this is... Seriously?”</p>

      <p>“Oh...?”</p>

      <p>Latora was grimacing at the sight of the monstrosity, but Ilzarl’s admiration was focused solely on its strength. They raised their voices in surprise, but Lishbaum’s sycophantic attitude remained unchanged as he turned to Moolah.</p>

      <p>“I believe this is the answer to the doubts lingering in your heart, Moolah-sama. All the demons sacrificed up until this point were fuel for the kiln. And in that fire, fresh pawns have been forged.”</p>

      <p>“Beings of such power... Just where have you been hiding them?”</p>

      <p>“Within the threshold.”</p>

      <p>“With your damn power? I see...”</p>

      <p>Recalling Lishbaum’s abilities, Moolah quietly muttered to herself, seemingly satisfied. But it appeared she wasn’t the only one that needed convincing.</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum, from what I see here, this doesn’t have the intelligence of the pawns we’ve been using.”</p>

      <p>Based on the demons Ilzarl knew, winged ones at least possessed the intelligence to comprehend language. But the one Lishbaum had summoned only had violent ferocity in its otherwise empty mind. There wasn’t a hint of understanding or any other semblance of intelligence in its eyes. However, Lishbaum didn’t see that as a bad thing.</p>

      <p>“As long as it is made obedient with power from the Evil God, intelligence isn’t exactly required, is it? If they’re strong enough, they needn’t think for themselves.”</p>

      <p>“That’s sure a strange answer coming from a bastard like you who uses his wits as a weapon.”</p>

      <p>“Our purpose is different. So to speak, this is a symbol of fear to the humans. If they could communicate with it, some of that fear would be negated. Not knowing what an opponent is thinking at all... That alone is something intelligent beings fear.”</p>

      <p>“Especially those frail humans, huh?”</p>

      <p>Seeing Ilzarl agree with him, Lishbaum nodded in satisfaction.</p>

      <p>“So how about it? Have I shown you something that meets all of your expectations?”</p>

      <p>“You’re saying we’re going to be bringing these things along with us from now on? With these, couldn’t we get things done with forces far smaller than what we’ve been using?”</p>

      <p>“Certainly, if we had more of these, those damn humans... Even the heroes would be nothing special.”</p>

      <p>Latora and Moolah each muttered their impressions and consented, but Ilzarl once again raised a question.</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum, there is something that I would like to ask you.”</p>

      <p>“Is there a problem regarding what I’ve presented to you?”</p>

      <p>“No, it’s about something else.”</p>

      <p>There, Lishbaum seemed to get the hint and flashed a dark grin.</p>

      <p>“In other words, you wish to ask me what happened that day, no?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. You seemed to know that human, so just what does that mean?”</p>

      <p>Ilzarl looked at Lishbaum through narrowed eyes, waiting for an answer. He was asking Lishbaum about his relationship with Suimei, and Lishbaum replied with a taunting smile. This, however, was the first Latora had heard of it.</p>

      <p>“Oh me, oh my! What’s this? You have a human acquaintance or something?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, well...”</p>

      <p>Lishbaum admitted it readily. He then glanced up at the ceiling like he was recalling something before continuing.</p>

      <p>“Originally, I come from a different world, you see. But even there, I was doing something similar.”</p>

      <p>The first to reply was yet again Ilzarl.</p>

      <p>“Something similar, huh? But this world you’re from didn’t have the Goddess and the Evil God... In that case, you mean to say you were still exterminating offerings?”</p>

      <p>“Though the goal was different.”</p>

      <p>“The goal was different? Is the extermination itself not the goal?”</p>

      <p>“To me, that is only the means. In a sense, you could say that my true goal is the antithesis of yours.”</p>

      <p>The other generals failed to grasp the true meaning behind Lishbaum’s cryptic words. Only Demon Lord Nakshatra laughed and nodded with a knowing look.</p>

      <p>“Hmph...” scoffed Ilzarl. “I don’t really think there’s anything for you to gain through just exterminating the offerings.”</p>

      <p>“No, that is not the case. From the very beginning, I never wanted anything.”</p>

      <p>Since the others present had never touched upon the many ideologies of man, they would likely never understand.</p>

      <p>“But alas, in the end, I was defeated by that man. Since I was attached to another phase, I lost a fair amount of power and should have been buried beyond the horizon of dimensions, but... Let us just say that I was fortunate to be forced into the physical world. And that is how I am here now.”</p>

      <p>Bringing that discussion to an end, Lishbaum turned the question on Ilzarl.</p>

      <p>“Now, what about you, Ilzarl-dono?”</p>

      <p>“What about me?”</p>

      <p>“The humans are meals to you. So by killing off your food source, you’re really killing off yourself, aren’t you? So what is it that motivates you to lend your power to Nakshatra-sama?”</p>

      <p>It was certainly as Lishbaum said. As a maneater, cooperating with the demons meant Ilzarl was intentionally helping to get rid of his own supply of food. It was a completely nonsensical, contradictory act, yet he responded with a composed air like he hardly considered it a problem.</p>

      <p>“Food or not, with so much riffraff, aren’t they just an eyesore? If they aren’t thinned out a little, they’ll just continue to be troublesome.”</p>

      <p>“And so you’re cooperating with us to that end? You mentioned thinning them out, but you do know we intend to annihilate them down to the last, don’t you?”</p>

      <p>“But that’s impossible.”</p>

      <p>Moolah was the only one who wrinkled her brow at Ilzarl’s bold declaration. But it was Lishbaum who questioned him.</p>

      <p>“And why do you say that?”</p>

      <p>“It’s nothing complicated. It’s just a matter of how gluttonous those offerings are. Contrary to what you might expect, they’re incredibly tenacious. Even if you kill some of them off, they just immediately surge forth from somewhere else. No matter how much you reduce their numbers and no matter how tightly you have them cornered, it happens every time. And if your objective truly is to exterminate them, you should understand that, shouldn’t you?”</p>

      <p>So confronted by Ilzarl, Lishbaum narrowed his eyes like something had just come to mind.</p>

      <p>“...Certainly, you do have a point about those teeming roaches.”</p>

      <p>Lishbaum ultimately conceded, but Moolah was furious. She held the demons, particularly the Evil God and the Demon Lord, in the highest regard. And belittling them was not something she could so easily pardon. Somehow managing to suppress her urge to draw her sword on the spot, she glared at the two of them as she raised her voice.</p>

      <p>“Ilzarl, you bastard! How dare you deny the ambitions of our God in the presence of Lord Nakshatra?!”</p>

      <p>“What, did I touch a nerve? Despite putting on such composed airs, you’re unexpectedly short-tempered.”</p>

      <p>“You ingrate...”</p>

      <p>Moolah channeled all of her intense bloodthirst at Ilzarl, who treated it as if it were nothing but a gentle breeze. It would take far more than that to intimidate him.</p>

      <p>“It is fine, Moolah. Stand down. We united fronts with Ilzarl knowing how he felt.”</p>

      <p>“With all due respect, even without the likes of him, we would not fall behind mere—”</p>

      <p>“Can you truly say that you yourself wouldn’t? In reality, the majority of those who used to occupy those empty seats thought the same. And yet they fell to ‘mere humans,’ as you put it.”</p>

      <p>“That only means that they were bad at their jobs.”</p>

      <p>In response to Moolah’s lack of compassion for the defeated, Ilzarl looked at her with a somewhat disappointed face.</p>

      <p>“Are you saying you’re any different?”</p>

      <p>“Do you wish to see for yourself?”</p>

      <p>Taking his words as provocation, Moolah began to pull her sword from its sheath. With the situation reaching critical mass, their fighting spirits met in a violent clash that released visible sparks. Things were genuinely about to get dangerous, and the one to raise their hand in mediation was Nakshatra.</p>

      <p>“Moolah, Ilzarl, that’s enough.”</p>

      <p>Hearing the Demon Lord’s decree, Ilzarl turned a faint smile to Moolah.</p>

      <p>“You heard her. So, what will you do, oh commander of the elite guard? Will you defy Nakshatra’s will and fight me? I honestly don’t mind either way.”</p>

      <p>“...I’ll remember this.”</p>

      <p>Glaring at him in annoyance, she returned her sword to its sheath. She would not defy Nakshatra, but she was unable to suppress her hostility for Ilzarl. Her fighting spirit and bloodthirst continued to rage. Seeing her so worked up, Nakshatra offered a few words of condoling explanation.</p>

      <p>“Moolah, to fulfill our ambitions, Ilzarl’s presence is necessary.”</p>

      <p>“My lord, could you enlighten your poor ignorant subject as to why?”</p>

      <p>With those words, Moolah once more knelt down before Nakshatra. When she did, Nakshatra smirked a little.</p>

      <p>“To compensate.”</p>

      <p>“To... compensate?”</p>

      <p>“That’s correct. All phenomena that occur and that are caused in this world, without exception, will have slight deviations. If you do not have the flexibility to take that into account and compensate for it, it will one day spell your ruin.”</p>

      <p>“That’s—”</p>

      <p>“We won’t let you say otherwise, do you hear us? That is precisely why the demons have gone so long without successfully achieving their goals. Do you understand? Our little bundle of demons is especially weak to unexpected phenomena.”</p>

      <p>“Then, to compensate for that, Ilzarl was invited to join us?”</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum as well. And in reality, they are doing fine work. Currently, there are foreign interlopers on the enemy side that we would be unable to deal with ourselves, and those two have become the power that restrains them.”</p>

      <p>“By foreign interlopers, you mean the four heroes?”</p>

      <p>“Your field of vision is too narrow, commander of our elite guard... And in that case, perhaps it would be best to have you face the humans yourself.”</p>

      <p>As Nakshatra muttered to herself, she glared over the other demon generals who had already fought in such battles before seeming to reach some kind of conclusion. She then raised her voice so that all could hear her.</p>

      <p>“We will now give our orders. First, Moolah. As Lishbaum informed you earlier, you will be given additional troops as a demon general. You may do as you have been until now, but you will no longer have the right to refuse command of units. As such, you will take your current pawns and push into the humans’ northern lands where they are shorthanded. If all goes smoothly, those who are lured in should answer your earlier question regarding tenacity.”</p>

      <p>“All is as you will, my lord.”</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum. You will throw the remaining pawns in the kiln and hurry with your work in increasing the supply of new pawns. We have the leisure of time, but it would be a poor move to let the heroes have too much of it and build up too much strength. Do at least keep that in mind.”</p>

      <p>“But of course.”</p>

      <p>“As for the rest of you, you shall have some free time until the new pawns are gathered. Once everything is ready, this time, we will seriously attack the humans. Husband your own strengths until then.”</p>

      <p>Hearing her words, everyone but Ilzarl obediently bowed their heads. Nakshatra then let her hopes for the future escape her lips with an irrepressible laugh.</p>

      <p>“Now then, humans... Both you and your Goddess are in for a rude awakening.”</p>

      <p>With that ominous prediction, the Demon Lord departed the room where the surviving demon generals were gathered.</p>
