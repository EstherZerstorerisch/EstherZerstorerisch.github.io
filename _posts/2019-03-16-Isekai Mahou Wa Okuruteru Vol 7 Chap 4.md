      <h1>Chapter 4: So That I Can Be Myself</h1>

      <p>On that mountain of pale pink flesh, there were countless grotesque eyes, small arms, and legs. This was Demon General Grallajearus, who was neither humanoid nor bestial. It was just a lump of meat. That was the only way to describe it. It was like a tumor that had swollen up without ever being excised, and did nothing but continue to grow.</p>

      <p>It was questionable to even conclude whether or not it was actually a demon, or any other kind of living creature, for that matter. And as long as the demon general stayed silent on the matter, there was no way of knowing.</p>

      <p>“Oh pebbles of Isa!”</p>

      <p>As Grallajearus’s voice rang out, Reiji and Titania could hear the sound of several objects piercing through the air as countless holes opened in Grallajearus’s body. Miniscule scraps of iron shot out like gunfire, propelled by a dark flash. In response to the attack, which they could barely follow with their eyes, Reiji and Titania had no choice but to run and evade. Faced with such a relentless attack, they didn’t even have an opening to fight back.</p>

      <p>“Shit, we can’t get closer like this...”</p>

      <p>If they did, they would fall prey to the projectiles. But it was also difficult for them to keep their distance. If they paused to try and look for an opening, the moment they stopped, they would be overwhelmed by the projectiles. Unable to advance and unable to withdraw, they were completely in a bind.</p>

      <p>It was unclear how they needed to fight this opponent. Despite its sluggish appearance, there was no telling how agile it was, which only disadvantaged them further. It felt as if they were fighting several machine guns at once with an endless pool of ammunition. But since closing in wasn’t an option, they would just have to do their best to attack at range.</p>

      <p>“Oh Earth! I beseech the solid lands! Turn thy pulsations into a violent tremor and gather below my feet! Exercise your authority, pierce through the air before me and rupture evil with this unavoidable stone! Grand Geyser!”</p>

      <p>Reiji quickly chanted a spell of the earth attribute and unleashed his keyword with no delay. When he did, countless giant pillars shot up from the ground around Grallajearus and took aim at the lump of flesh. Reiji didn’t take the time to properly aim all the pillars, but there were enough of them covering a wide enough range that it didn’t matter. The pillars tapered to a point and pierced Grallajearus. However...</p>

      <p>“Did you really think this kind of haphazard attack would strike us down, hero?!”</p>

      <p>As an unpleasant shriek reverberated like shrill noise in the air, Grallajearus’s fleshy body began bubbling and swelling, filling in the damaged portions. By the time the pillars of earth wrought by Grand Geyser vanished, Grallajearus’s body was right back to how it was before he’d been wounded.</p>

      <p>“So this guy can regenerate...?”</p>

      <p>Reiji muttered as the impatience tingling his spine grew stronger. The menace of something that could heal its wounds immediately stalled his judgment. He couldn’t just carelessly swing at it, and any halfhearted attacks would surely be useless. He bit down on his lip, realizing he was at a loss for what to do. That was when Titania called out from behind him.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-sama, I will take the front line for a moment. While the demon general is focused on me, go around and attack him.”</p>

      <p>“Got it.”</p>

      <p>After accepting her suggestion, Reiji distanced himself from Titania. Taking advantage of the fact that the demons were also steering clear of Grallajearus’s attack, Reiji quickly began to circle around his target as Titania resolutely cut forward. She moved left and right, as if toying with her opponent, and Reiji felt like he was only seeing the optical illusion of her blurry afterimage. It appeared that, even with its many eyes, Grallajearus was also unable to keep up with her movements and shifted its focus entirely to her.</p>

      <p>Everything was going well.</p>

      <p>Confirming that the plan was working, Reiji circled around to Grallajearus’s rear. Cutting down the demons in his path, he swung wide and ran up the cliff. He then spotted Titania retreating a great distance.</p>

      <p>“HAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>

      <p>Judging that the timing was right, Reiji channeled his fighting spirit into a single slash. As his orichalcum blade thrusted towards Grallajearus from behind, its oddly embedded eyes that had been focused on Titania suddenly shifted all at once and turned their collective gaze on Reiji.</p>

      <p>“Urgh!”</p>

      <p>Even its little arms and legs, as if following the movement of its eyes, began to squirm chaotically. And then the iron scraps shot out at him—the pebbles of Isa. In an attempt to escape the blast radius of the buckshot, Reiji twisted his body and threw himself to the floor in a roll. However, even the direction he was rolling in was within the pebbles of Isa’s range.</p>

      <p>“Ugh, oh Earth! Surround me and become a firm bulwark! Absolutely none shall pass and threaten this life! Earth Wall Rising!”</p>

      <p>Chanting a defensive spell, Reiji created a wall of earth with his mana as he laid on the ground. The wall, which was supposed to be able to defend him from any attack, fended off the first wave of the pebbles of Isa just as he planned. However, like with a machine gun, the bullets just kept coming. The wall of earth protected Reiji from the initial rounds, but the incessant iron scraps began to wear away at it. At this rate, it would only hold for a few more seconds. When Reiji realized that, he hurriedly stood back up to run away.</p>

      <p>“What a relentless attack...”</p>

      <p>“Do not underestimate us, hero! Did you think we would fall for such an infantile plan?!” Grallajearus angrily boomed at Reiji.</p>

      <p>Reiji was left bewildered by their failed attack. Just how had Grallajearus done that? It was supposed to be entirely focused on Titania. He was certain all of its many eyes had been pointed towards her. It was as if, somehow, its organs were operating independently from one another. As if it were an existence made up of many beings.</p>

      <p>“I see.”</p>

      <p>That was probably it.</p>

      <p>“You’re... a legion, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right! We are an army of hundreds, and we are all one! We will not be destroyed by such narrow-minded attacks by you damnable humans!”</p>

      <p>Grallajearus loudly shrieked in praise of its own being. At least it explained the mysterious way it referred to itself as “us.” Its arms, legs, eyes, and odd lumps of meat were all independent of each other. And when it fired out the pebbles of Isa, it was a peerless opponent who was difficult to approach.</p>

      <p><em>This is bad...</em></p>

      <p>A bitter taste began to spread in Reiji’s mouth. The fact that he was in a challenging fight with a demon general was one thing, but the demon army digging deeper into the encampment made it much worse. He couldn’t take his sweet time with this one.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-sama! For now, you should...”</p>

      <p>“Ugh... Is this thing really too much of an opponent for me...?”</p>

      <p>“Obviously. You will die in obscurity right here, you bastard. Die regretting the fact that you made light of us demons!”</p>

      <p>And at Grallajearus’s command, the demons in the area attacked. It looked like they were planning to surround and overwhelm Reiji. And to make matters worse, it was currently taking everything Reiji and Titania had just to deal with Grallajearus alone. Graziella was busy protecting Reanat with the other members of the Elite Twelve, so she wasn’t there to support them. At this rate, defeat would be inevitable.</p>

      <p>“Tch... Tia, what should we do?”</p>

      <p>“It is vital that we withdraw from here for now. The only choice is to break through the demons in the direction of our allies.”</p>

      <p>“But if we do that, we’ll be leaving our backs open for the demon general.”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Therefore, I will serve as the rearguard. Reiji-sama, break out of the encirclement as fast as you can and regroup with our allies.”</p>

      <p>“I can’t do that! If I do, Tia, you’ll...!”</p>

      <p>Unable to accept her plan, Reiji loudly refused Titania. However...</p>

      <p>“It is alright. Reiji-sama, please believe in me.”</p>

      <p>“Tia...”</p>

      <p>Reiji couldn’t approve of using her as a shield and running away. But he couldn’t think of any other means of getting out of this situation. As things were, both of them were going to die. Titania was simply proposing to shoulder that burden by herself. Reiji ground his teeth. Yet once again, he felt powerless. He had to be protected by his companions. And just as he was starting to think he might really have to accept this bitter dilemma...</p>

      <p>“Oh Earth. I beseech the solid lands. Turn thy pulsations into a violent tremor and threaten all from beneath. Exercise your authority and become the foundation that supports all in existence. Pierce through the air, rupture evil, become an unavoidable stone and break through. Grand Geyser Refinement!”</p>

      <p>A woman’s voice rang in the air, and Reiji heard keywords he never had before. It was a spell far more powerful than the one he’d used earlier. Immediately following the keywords, the earth below protruded outwards. The spell Reiji had used created enormous sharpened pillars, but the magic manifesting now looked more like porcupine needles as large swords sprung diagonally from the ground.</p>

      <p>The demons were shredded by the excessively dense cloud of blades, bringing them to a bloody and miserable end. Before long, the effect of the magic vanished, and the ground evened out to its original state. From the settling dust, a single girl stepped over the pile of demon corpses that now scattered the ground. It was none other than Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“My goodness, do not look so tense when you are before me.”</p>

      <p>“Io Kuzami-san...”</p>

      <p>“Indeed, oh fiancé of mine. The fact that you had forgotten about me is something I will later be questioning you about deeply, very deeply—deeper than the Japan Trench. So stay put as you prepare yourself for that.”</p>

      <p>As Io Kuzami thrust her index finger at him pointedly, she laid bare her dissatisfaction. Despite the situation being what it was, she carried herself in as carefree a manner as usual. However, in complete contrast to her attitude, the demon encirclement was still roaring and raging. The path she’d created to get to her allies had already filled back in.</p>

      <p>“Io Kuzami-dono, please take care of Reiji-sama. I will take the rear and—”</p>


      <p>“Like I’ve been saying, do not decide that it is a disadvantageous situation without me.”</p>

      <p>“But at this rate...!”</p>

      <p>As Titania persisted, Io Kuzami let out a grand sigh. It sounded like she was tired of them worrying about pointless matters.</p>

      <p>“What kind of misunderstanding are you fools under? You are not the only ones fighting this battle. Do you really believe that you are the only strong ones present?”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>Bewildered by Io Kuzami’s words, Reiji inadvertently let slip a gasp of surprise. There were other strong people. So she said. But the only ones capable of breaking through here were himself, Titania, Io Kuzami, and Graziella. Reiji and Titania were hard-pressed, regardless of whether they advanced or retreated. Graziella and the Elite Twelve had their hands full with other matters. So the only one Titania could entrust protecting Reiji to was Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>Was there somebody else that could break them out of their predicament? While wondering about that, Reiji could suddenly feel a tremendous agitation of mana from the imperial side. He could feel it in his body and in the shaking earth. It felt just like the resonance one felt before a tremendous power was unleashed. Reiji wondered if it might be Graziella’s earth magic as an unnatural sound reverberated in the air despite there being no walls for the sound to bounce off of. It was a woman’s voice.</p>

      <p>“Mana Furnace Core. White Fire, Immediate Critical Load!”</p>

      <p>Her severe yet gentle mellifluous voice activated a few keywords, and immediately following that...</p>

      <p>The agitated mana that had been shaking their surroundings swelled up explosively. A wave of mana blew against them, followed by an intense heat. It felt like the very sun had descended down towards the earth. Faced with the mixture of a shockwave and hot wind, Reiji, the others, and even the demons were completely forced to the ground.</p>

      <p>And then, a cruel chill suddenly assaulted Reiji’s body. It was a similar sensation to when he heard a scary story, or when he went to supposedly haunted locations. A sensation that told him something bad was going to happen—a feeling most people got at least once in their lives. And everything that was making his body tremble amplified that cold sensation.</p>

      <p>“Th-This is...?”</p>

      <p>“Suimei? No, just who...?”</p>

      <p>“Heh, I see. So that guy has drilled quite an extraordinary lesson into her. Though he’s always playing the fool, he certainly does not miss a step. His little charade makes me quite envious, actually... to the point that it stimulates this curse of mine.”</p>

      <p>Reiji and Titania were both bewildered. But Io Kuzami smiled boldly like she knew exactly what was going on. At the very least, she knew something. And the moment Reiji was about to ask her what it was, the next chant echoed in the air.</p>

      <p>“Rain, oh rain. Oh hot, hot rain of fire that pours incessantly without exhausting my mysteries. Just like the white smoke of clouds and fog worn by the skies, cover the earth with a baptism of white fire that pardons no evil. Show not the mercy of compassion to those who disturb the world, to those who soil the world. And so, purify the lands and admonish them with the fires of judgment handed down from the heavens. Rainblaze Clouds.”</p>

      <p>The keywords were “Rainblaze Clouds,” and those words alone made the nature of the spell quite apparent.</p>

      <p>A large white magic circle stretched out across the ground, and mirroring it, another magic circle formed in the blue sky above. As they revolved in opposite directions, a white electric current crackled between them. When that current struck the clear sky, white clouds slowly took shape and swirled into a vortex.</p>

      <p>The sky was gradually becoming cloudy. However, in complete contrast, the ground below was still as bright as day. As far as spells go, this one was slow to activate. To Reiji, it only looked like it was creating clouds. However, as he suspected, that wasn’t all there was to it. With a drip and a drop, tears began falling from the sky.</p>

      <p>Rain began to douse the battlefield. Perhaps due to the white clouds covering the sky, the small raindrops looked like they were a cloudy white. They left thread-like trails behind them as they fell towards the demons, and only the demons.</p>

      <p>But those droplets were not actually rain at all. They were plasma that gave off a white light. Indeed, it was raining white-hot fire. And as those deadly droplets came into contact with the demons, their bodies turned into a mass of white flames. Naturally, they had no way of resisting it. Even as they began to clad themselves in the dark power they used to resist magic, their bodies were left completely exposed to the rain. And as soon as it touched them, they were set aflame with white fire. When they tried to brush it off of themselves, it spread even more quickly to other demons around them. It all happened in the blink of an eye. The white fire spread out like a blaze in a dry field, and almost all of the nearby demons were annihilated.</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>Seeing such a disastrous scene, Reiji was at a complete loss for words. And at the same time, a freezing chill assaulted his spine. It wasn’t particularly because of the spell, either. The power of the magic was certainly great, but that wasn’t the true source of the fear he felt. Creating a large amount of clouds in the sky and bathing everything underneath it in white fire wasn’t such an unusual feat for a spell. But as he looked overhead, the clouds hanging in the sky seemed to be spreading out. They soon overshadowed the entire camp.</p>

      <p>And then it hit him. It was the scale of the spell that was so unbelievable.</p>

      <p>Unsure as to whether or not he could call this phenomenon magic anymore, he was left speechless. Titania, who was standing next to him, was also quite surprised, as she narrowed her alert eyes. Io Kuzami was standing there with her brow knit in dissatisfaction. But as it turned out, they weren’t the only ones to be caught off guard.</p>

      <p>“Wh-What is this?! This magic... Magic of this kind of scale is impossible!”</p>

      <p>The one to raise such a chorus of shock was Demon General Grallajearus. Even as a demon general, it was the first time it had seen this kind of magic. When it faced off against Reiji and Titania earlier, it was thoroughly composed. But not anymore. Right now, it was extremely perturbed. Before long, the caster of the spell finally approached the group through the white rain—Felmenia Stingray.</p>

      <p>“To call something of this level impossible... That in itself is the definition of foolishness. There are only a small handful of things that are truly impossible in the world. What I have done is rather simple compared to those feats.”</p>

      <p>“This damn magic was your doing?!”</p>

      <p>As Grallajearus raised its voice in disbelief, Felmenia quietly nodded. Grallajearus then questioned her more in bewilderment.</p>

      <p>“What the hell are you?! If you’re not a hero, how can you use so much power?! Are you really just a damn human?!”</p>

      <p>“Well, regarding that... Just the other day, I resolved to take my leave of being one.”</p>

      <p>As Felmenia made that quiet, cold declaration, a sudden fearful chill ran up the backs of every single being present. She was taking her leave of being human... The one who was caught on those words the most was none other than the one who’d asked her about her humanity in the first place—Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“T-Take your leave, you say...? Are you saying you are a human who’s stopped being a human...?”</p>

      <p>“Regarding that, let’s just say that it’s of no concern to a demon.”</p>

      <p>“M-Making light of me...”</p>

      <p>“By the way, is it fine to only focus on me? I’m not your only enemy here, am I?”</p>

      <p>“What—?”</p>

      <p>What followed after Grallajearus’s confused voice was a hearty war cry.</p>

      <p>“YAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>

      <p>It was a rather masculine and violent cry, but the voice was that of a woman.</p>

      <p>BOMPH!</p>

      <p>Along with a deep, low-frequency sound which resounded in everyone’s stomach, a mass of bodies flew into the sky above the circle of demons who were still being consumed by the white flames. Their bodies were gruesomely scattered into pieces from the shock of the strike.</p>

      <p>Following that, the fence of burning demons was blown back by a shockwave. And beyond that fence was a girl carrying a gigantic halberd. She had bright blue hair and a small stature. She grimaced and shook her hand in the air as if she’d just touched something nasty. Her expression was definitely not one of someone who was fighting the sworn enemy of humanity. It was of someone who was driving away an unpleasant insect.</p>

      <p>“Who is...”</p>

      <p>As Titania was about to ask who it was, Felmenia answered before she could finish.</p>


      <p>“Your Royal Highness, that is an ally. But do note that it is only a temporary one...”</p>

      <p>“Temporary?”</p>

      <p>“Well, yeah.”</p>

      <p>The one to reply to Titania was the petite girl Felmenia called an ally. She must have heard their conversation. She then thrust her halberd towards Reiji and Titania.</p>

      <p>“Yo, Hero of Salvation and Twilight Beheading Princess. The name’s Jillbert Griga. Just for today, I’ll be lending ya a teensy hand, alright? Ah, also, I won’t be answering annoying questions like ‘Why?’ or ‘What’s your aim?’ You got that? And that’s ’cause they’re all things there’s no point in you knowing! Now, take this!”</p>

      <p>After declaring that, she once more swung her halberd and separated the axe blade from the shaft. Extending the chain that linked them together, she began to scatter the remaining demons in a circle around them.</p>

      <p>Along with Felmenia’s magic, almost all the demons in the area were now defeated or left powerless. The only one gnashing their teeth in response to that was, naturally, Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“Th-That many, by just the two of you...”</p>

      <p>“Hah! You’re naive for thinking you can just drag along a mishmash of these damn powerless pests! Don’t look down on humans, stupid! Idiot! Ah, but I’m a dwarf, though...”</p>

      <p>“Besides, it is not just our power. There are the imperial soldiers here as well.”</p>

      <p>As Felmenia glanced behind her, Graziella had already pulled together the soldiers, and they were exterminating the remaining demons.</p>

      <p>“Everyone, show some spirit! We’re going to support Reiji!”</p>

      <p>“HAH!”</p>

      <p>As Graziella gave her orders, the imperial soldiers shouted back in unison. They were thrown into chaos and left at a disadvantage, but from the looks of it, they quickly rearranged their position and were now pushing back the ambush.</p>

      <p>However, it could be said that what granted them a means of survival was, without a doubt, Felmenia’s magic. As Grallajearus also seemed to fully understand that fact, it fired off the pebbles of Isa towards her with rage.</p>

      <p>“You damn little girl!”</p>

      <p>“Oh barrier. Deploy.”</p>

      <p>In response, Felmenia muttered out a chant. And immediately, a thick wall of mana appeared before her and obstructed the countless iron scraps sent flying by Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“A magic shield cannot stand before our pebbles of Isa!”</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately for you, this is a barrier.”</p>

      <p>“Nonsense!”</p>

      <p>After that, the pebbles of Isa poured out relentlessly, but the barrier put up by Felmenia didn’t falter. Despite the fact that the wall of earth Reiji used crumbled in an instant, Felmenia had, with a far shorter chant, using a spell he had never heard before, and with no keyword, created a shield that could withstand it.</p>

      <p>Before long, Grallajearus could tell that the pebbles of Isa would not work, and stopped the barrage. And as he did, Felmenia’s barrier also vanished.</p>

      <p>“Demon general. That sort of attack will not work on me. Resign yourself.”</p>

      <p>“Gu...! This kind of...”</p>

      <p>Felmenia further increased the mana clad around her and threatened the demon with overwhelming pressure. Seeing her like that, Titania let out her admiration with a smile.</p>

      <p>“As expected, White Flame-dono is quite reliable.”</p>

      <p>“N-No, it wasn’t much...”</p>

      <p>In a complete change from her dreadful aura just now, Felmenia began to feel embarrassed. Her expression crumbled before the praise and admiration from the princess of her own country. However the mana she was accumulating remained the same, and she didn’t show any signs of carelessness. Before long, Graziella had finished cleaning up the remaining demons and joined up with them.</p>

      <p>“Is all that’s left that monster?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. A demon general that called itself Grallajearus.”</p>

      <p>Titania answered her. Perhaps because of the battle, her tone was somewhat gloomy, but Graziella responded with a fearless laugh.</p>

      <p>“With this much power gathered together, it doesn’t matter if it’s a demon general...”</p>

      <p>“Your Imperial Highness, it is still dangerous to be so careless.”</p>

      <p>“I know that much without you telling me. Right, Reiji... Reiji?”</p>

      <p>Though Graziella called out to him, Reiji didn’t respond. And as she was baffled by his unexpected behavior, Reiji suddenly stepped towards Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-sama?!”</p>

      <p>“Hey! What are you being so impudent for?!”</p>

      <p>The two princesses began panicking as Reiji stepped in on his own. Though they tried to restrain him as they called out, Reiji did not turn to look at them.</p>

      <p>“I will defeat this guy on my own. I want all of you to stay out of it.”</p>

      <p>“But Reiji-sama—”</p>

      <p>“I have to do this on my own.”</p>

      <p>Reiji ignored Titania’s voice. He had to do it himself. His resolve was the result of how the tide of this battle had gone. Because he felt worthless for having decided to cast away Titania as a sacrifice so he could flee. In order to climb over this wall, he had to do this on his own.</p>

      <p>Despite seeing his determined silhouette, Titania still insisted on stopping him. But before she could, Jillbert thrust out her halberd to stop her.</p>

      <p>“Let him do it. Everyone feels like they got to do it themselves once in a while.”</p>

      <p>“What are you...?”</p>

      <p>“It’s a ritual. For a man to become a warrior, right? You’re also one of those types, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p>Saying that, Jillbert winked and smiled at Titania. It was true that one had to stand firm to become a warrior, so Titania was unable to say anything back. As Reiji stepped forward on his path to becoming a man, Grallajearus started making an uproar.</p>

      <p>“You’ll defeat us all on your own, you say? It was already proven that your pitiful power is not enough to defeat us! Are you touched in the head?!”</p>

      <p>“I haven’t gone crazy or anything. It’s just because... this is what I must do. So I will do it.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t get carried away, you damn brat! Have you mistaken the power given to you by the goddess as your own strength?!”</p>

      <p>“I know full well that this is a temporary power that I was given. That’s why... That’s exactly why! I need to surpass my limits!”</p>

      <p>“Are you saying we’re your damn stepping stone or something?!”</p>

      <p>“That’s right! I will defeat you and step over that boundary!”</p>

      <p>With a roar, Reiji advanced towards Grallajearus. As he screamed, he dashed forward for the sake of surpassing that wall. As he drew closer, the pebbles of Isa were fired out in a flash. And Reiji began evading them as he circled around Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“After howling so vigorously, is all you can do evade, HEROOOOO?!”</p>

      <p>“Ugh...”</p>

      <p>A pebble of Isa grazed Reiji’s face and left a cut on his cheek. He stepped forward with conviction, but as if he was being toyed with, it took all his effort just to keep moving. He couldn’t spot any opening in which to attack, let alone to attain victory. No, that kind of thing never existed in the first place. With just the fact that he had rushed into a hard fight, any hope of victory had been wiped out.</p>

      <p>But even so, Reiji had to climb that wall. Even if it was reckless, even if it was foolish. He was pushed back by Rajas, Elliot took it easy on him, he was completely subdued by Ilzarl... Even here and now, he was completely outclassed. He couldn’t just resign himself to being such a half-baked hero from here on out.</p>

      <p>That was because he had companions he could rely on. Even now, they were behind him, calling out to him in concern. Let’s cooperate and defeat it. Don’t be reckless. All he heard were kind voices.</p>

      <p>He was always being saved like that by someone. But was that really what a hero was? Was it really okay for him to call himself a hero like that? Without saving anyone, while only being saved himself? Only to be placed on a pedestal and carried above others like a buffoon?</p>

      <p>He could not accept that. Ever. Being a flashy showpiece and nothing more held no meaning. There was no way he could accept such deception.</p>

      <p>“I won’t lose!”</p>

      <p>“For the sake of the Goddess?! Or perhaps for the sake of the people?!”</p>

      <p>“Wrong! It has nothing to do with heroes, goddesses, or the people of this world! It’s all for myself!”</p>

      <p>That was why. That was exactly why. The time to take a great stride was now. Up until now, he remained the same and took advantage of the good will of his companions. But it was time to separate himself from that dependence.</p>

      <p>Even if he couldn’t fly, as long as he never took the leap on his own, he would never learn it for himself. That was why he had to step forward now. That was why—</p>

      <p>“I will... I will become stronger! I want to become stronger!”</p>

      <p>His thoughts, his desires, he yelled them all at himself, and just at that time...</p>

      <p><em>If you desire it, then request it and call out.</em></p>

      <p>“Huh...?”</p>

      <p><em>The final gate that connects to a great power at all times exists within you.</em></p>

      <p>“Wh-Who...”</p>

      <p>As a robotic pronouncement suddenly resounded in his head, Reiji unexpectedly raised his voice to question it. And when he realized this, he was standing all alone in the middle of a mud-like darkness.</p>

      <p>“Wh-What? Where? Wh-Why...?”</p>

      <p>As a baffling situation presented itself around him, Reiji was seized by surprise. He was definitely in the military encampment of the imperial army, and was right in front of Grallajearus. And in spite of that, he couldn’t see those things anywhere. They were nowhere to be found. Everywhere he looked, there was only darkness, and something which looked like a light far in the distance.</p>

      <p>However, all of that was gone in a flash. That was because the small light in the depths of the darkness became bluer and bluer...</p>

      <p>“Ah...”</p>

      <p>As if entranced by the distant sparkling blue light, an enraptured voice came out of his mouth without him realizing. His mind was the same as that enraptured voice, simply dumbfounded. That passion with which he was denying himself as he yelled was wiped away, and all that remained was that blue light.</p>

      <p>He had seen that light before. It was none other than the light given off by the gem installed in the Sacrament.</p>

      <p>And in that instant, he suddenly understood. That light was something that he had to head towards no matter what. Beyond that light, the answer to everything was awaiting him.</p>

      <p>That’s why he broke into a run. He ran and ran, with all his strength to grasp that blue light.</p>

      <p>And immediately, words appeared in his head. A voice with no voice, and that was...</p>

      <p><em>By my Lapis’s blue brilliance, crystallize the sword spirit.</em></p>

      <p>And as those words repeated, the blue light grew stronger. And as that light spread, it gathered in his hand—but before he could hear the last words, the dazzling light vanished.</p>

      <p>When he came to, that tunnel of darkness and the blue light were no longer there, and the scenery returned to that of the imperial military encampment. And before his eyes, Grallajearus was sneering.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. Just as I was wondering what you were doing, all that did was give off a bit of light.”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>If it was as it said, Reiji was likely giving off a blue light just now. In his right hand, he was suddenly gripping the Ishar Cluster. He had unconsciously grabbed it, or perhaps the blue light he was grasping was, in fact, the Sacrament itself.</p>

      <p>As the Sacrament continued to give off a pale light, it was like he was staring at the trailing memory of that blue light. If it was just as Grallajearus said, all it did was give off light. He was probably just standing there as a blue light overflowed from his hand. As proof of that, unlike the time he fought Ilzarl, the Sacrament didn’t turn into a weapon. Because he couldn’t hear those last words to manifest the weapon, this was only a natural deduction.</p>

      <p>However, even so, he was still able to grasp that blue light. He could see the path. He could see the door. He could hear the mysteries of that blue light, the voice with no voice. Therefore, the amount of power he grasped—it wasn’t zero.</p>

      <p>“Wha—?!”</p>

      <p>Grasping his orichalcum sword once more, he moved with the same speed which overwhelmed Ilzarl, and he could hear a chorus of shock in front of him. It was likely that it looked like he had vanished before its many eyes.</p>

      <p>This demon general wasn’t stronger than Ilzarl. In every respect, it was inferior. It was remarkably inferior. If Reiji was going to lose against such an opponent, his suffering from this point would be unfathomable. That was why—</p>

      <p>The number of times he could deceive its eyes was only this once. Winning against an enemy like this from straight on was truly a victory suitable of praise.</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>One step. With one step, in complete silence, he swung his orichalcum sword. Repelling the pebbles, which flew like bullets. Trampling the earth under his feet. With that tenacious single step, his boot sank into the ground, and the ground around his boot swelled up like goosebumps.</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>As he drew close, Grallajearus’s voice couldn’t be heard. He could no longer hear anything. It was raising an uproar, but Reiji no longer perceived it as sound. Its words of disbelief and protest didn’t even reach his ears. His blood had run cold from being pushed back by this opponent only a moment ago, but now Reiji understood the ultimate reality. However, there was not a particle of happiness in him. He did not step forward in order to gain a sense of superiority.</p>

      <p>The demon general was only a few more steps away. It was in range, if he thrust out his sword. At that distance, the demon general abandoned hope and poorly fired out the pebbles of Isa in desperation. But it was too slow. Before they were even fired, Reiji could see through all of it, and the march to victory was determined before it even began. As he drew closer with his sword at the ready, Grallajearus screamed.</p>

      <p>“We are legion! Know that an attack from a sword is meaningless before us!”</p>

      <p>He could hear angry voices. No, there was a small of amount of bluffing mixed in. Having fallen into an inferior position, it relied on bravado to cheer itself on. Like it had declared, the fact that it was an army was a nuisance. However.</p>

      <p>“Is that so?”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“Even if you are a legion, the fact that you share a single consciousness means that there must be some sort of source which houses that consciousness. If there wasn’t, you would just be a disconnected mess of chaos. Isn’t that right?”</p>

      <p>As the truth was revealed before it, Grallajearus’s voice became filled with panic.</p>

      <p>“Wh-Why do you... Why do you know that?!”</p>

      <p>“Light...”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“That blue light told me.”</p>

      <p>What gave him that idea was the blue light. When he touched that blue light, the voice with no voice whispered it to him. ‘That is definitely an opponent you can defeat...’</p>

      <p>And so, as Reiji unerringly swung downwards, he slashed apart the small vital core deep within Grallajearus.</p>

      <p class="centerp section-marking">★</p>

      <p>Around the same time that Reiji and Titania’s fight against Grallajearus and Lefille’s fight with Latora started...</p>

      <p>After distancing himself from the main encampment, Suimei was clashing with demons about halfway to Lefille’s position.</p>

      <p>“O flammae, legito. Pro venefici doloris clamore.”</p>

      <p><em>[Oh flames, assemble. Like the cry of the magician’s resentment.]</em></p>

      <p>Following his chant, Suimei unleashed Ashurbanipal’s flame upon the swarm of incoming demons. Based on a curse from Assyrian legend, it was fire magicka that was remarkably efficient against living creatures. At the start of the chant, it formed several small magicka circles at odd intervals in the air. And as the chant progressed, a sphere of fire formed in the center of them all. It burned like it had a shining stone at its core, and was obviously no normal fire. Dense flames then shot out of the smaller magicka circles to incinerate their targets. A conflagration danced its way through the crowd of demons. The demons caught in it were denied the chance to even scream before they crumbled to the ground as ash.</p>

      <p>So even if he was outnumbered, Suimei clearly wasn’t hurting for firepower. Yet nevertheless, the demons didn’t falter in their charge towards him. It was like they were machines that knew nothing of adaptability, devoted to one single pre-programmed command.</p>

      <p>Suimei was currently moving against the demon army on his own. His plan was more or less “search and destroy.” A few days had passed since the test matches at the encampment, and after the imperial army had established its foothold in this battle, Reiji’s companions were finally allowed to join the fight. In a private conversation with Reanat, Suimei had asked if there were demons traveling along any paths that weren’t booby trapped. Reanat had said there were, so Suimei had asked to take care of those. Of course, since he was working alone, he’d added the caveat, “To the extent that I can.”</p>

      <p>“Originally, I planned to get paid for this, but it isn’t too bad if I think of it as doing a favor to lessen the burden on Lefille and Reiji, really.”</p>

      <p>Before heading out, Suimei had made that declaration at the encampment. In his world, the work of magicians came at a high price, so it was perfectly natural for him to think about compensation when lending a hand. But this time, there were also his companions to think about, as well as the fact that he was being supplied with food and any other provisions he needed. In light of that, he tried to think of this as an exchange of sorts.</p>

      <p>Of course, he also thought it would be perfectly reasonable if he didn’t stick his neck out at all. For the time being, in order to keep Reiji from suspecting anything, he was supposedly assisting Lefille’s unit. He’d departed with them, but then parted ways with them in order to move on his own.</p>

      <p>Spreading out a map and confirming the position of the stars, he determined where he was and where the units sent out to stall the demons were. Avoiding them and the paths that the imperial troops were using, he strengthened his body with magicka and made his way through the treacherous mountain terrain, practically skipping and humming until he came across a force of demons.</p>

      <p>There were easily two hundred of them, all of which were moving on foot. An infantry unit, it seemed, advancing through the forest in a single clump. Mowing down trees as they pressed forward like they owned the place, they looked just like a giant caterpillar devouring a leaf as it moved across it.</p>

      <p>And unlike the mostly humanoid demons that so often appeared in fantasy stories, these were much closer to beasts and insects. They had large builds twice the size of even the tallest basketball players. They had exoskeletons covered in pitch black cuticle, which looked as hard as rock. Like they were talking amongst themselves, their spidery mandibles were clattering ominously.</p>

      <p>“Ugeh...”</p>

      <p>They inspired an unrivaled feeling of revulsion in Suimei. Compared to them, the demons he’d met before were much easier on the eyes. Their external appearance was much more put together than these creepy ones. Suimei found them absolutely revolting and unconsciously expressed his disgust with a groan. But now that he’d found them, he had to do something about them. He was at the crossroads of deciding how to proceed.</p>

      <p>Should he annihilate them? Or should he just deal a devastating blow to the group and then retreat? With this many of them, two or three grand magickas would take care of the whole lot. But thinking about it from the perspective of the strategy the Empire was putting into play, it would be fine if he didn’t go that far. All he really had to do was stall them and, if the circumstances permitted, take a few of them out before reporting back. However...</p>

      <p><em>Considering what’s to come...</em></p>

      <p>Suimei’s sudden anxiety wasn’t about the fight before him, but about himself. He had no misgivings about throwing down with the demons, but right now, they weren’t the only shadow looming over him.</p>

      <p>His biggest concern was the Universal Apostles, Eanru’s group led by the mirage man. He genuinely and truly considered them a serious threat. There was Eanru’s sheer physical strength, not to mention the talent the mirage man had displayed with his magicka. Thinking about his inevitable conflict with them, Suimei knew he had to fight and grow stronger. Next time, he wanted to be able to stand up to them.</p>

      <p>“That’s why... Well, I know I need to sharpen my battle senses, but...”</p>

      <p>It just seemed like a poor plan to simply throw himself into the middle of a demon army for that. A magician had to fight like a magician. There was nothing to be gained from recklessly rushing into battle. Moreover, the goal he was chasing was vague.</p>

      <p>But, with things as they stood, he felt pressured to take on this reckless, vague challenge. He wasn’t happy with the way he was, and he wanted to change that. If he simply stood still, the day would again come where he would be smeared across the earth.</p>

      <p>Reaffirming the determination in his heart, Suimei jumped out from the shadow of a tree. The demons immediately raised their ear-grating voices as they rushed towards him. They wanted to tear apart his weak human body with their claws and sharp insectoid mouthpieces.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t just their strength they were relying on. What made them the most dangerous was the dark power surrounding their bodies. It was like a mysterious, sinister aura. Different from the negative powers behind dark magic, it was the power that drew from the Evil God as a source. If someone who didn’t posses the Goddess’s protection took a blow from that to their bare flesh, it wouldn’t end with a simple wound.</p>

      <p>“However...”</p>

      <p>However, just what was there that he had to fear about that? Certainly, the Evil God’s power was astounding. Almost all deific power was. But compared to all of the other fights he’d been through before this day, it didn’t scare him. He’d fought far worse, and frequently, at that.</p>

      <p>Naturally, those were fights against wielders of mystical powers. But really, it could be said that even the most common fights in his world surpassed those here. In the modern world, almost all fighting was carried out with technology and military tactics that made full use of it. Machine guns that could fire a hail of bullets. Anti-tank grenades like the RPG-7 that granted a single human terrifying destructive potential. Flying at mach 2, anti-ship missiles that could accurately strike from two kilometers away, not to mention the missile cruisers that housed them. Assault helicopters like the Super Hind that could gun down humans from the sky.</p>

      <p>Remembering his fights against such things, just how could fighting against demons even compare? Recalling fighting opponents with attacks that came in near the speed of sound from unknown locations, the threat of an attack he could see right in front of him was nearly laughable. He could probably handle this with one hand tied behind his back, if not both.</p>

      <p>Dodging the strike coming straight at him from the front and defending against the claws swinging in from the side with magicka, he returned the attack with fire magicka. As the rest of the demons closed in, he blew away the ground beneath them as he jumped into the air.</p>

      <p>“O flammae, legito. Pro venefici doloris clamore. Parito colluctatione et aestuato. Deferto impedimentum fatum atrox.”</p>

      <p><em>[Oh flames, assemble. Like the cry of the magician’s resentment. Give form to death’s agony and burst into flames. Bestow the one who obstructs me with a dreadful destiny.]</em></p>

      <p>Under the clear blue sky, Suimei’s chant brought about a burst of fire in the forest. White smoke from all the incinerated demon flesh rose into the air, and the earth was bathed in red. It was like the scenery of a nightmare. Below that refreshing blue sky that would calm anybody’s heart, a banquet of burning hell was unfolding. That impression didn’t seem to change no matter how many times he witnessed it. Knitting his brow at the screams and carnage, Suimei indulged himself in idle thoughts for a moment.</p>

      <p><em>In any case, what does it mean that the demons move in such monotonous, predictable ways?</em></p>

      <p>What came to mind was something he’d been curious about for quite a while now. From what Suimei had seen to date, the demons fought using the singular strategy of trying to push straight into human territory. Even when Vuishta caught Hatsumi in his scheme, the main force of the demon army was still just charging straight forward in a frontal attack.</p>

      <p>The demons would take up formations with tactless simplicity, but they hardly relied on strategy. Their only tactics were to move forward using brute force to overcome. It was arguably an effective tactic considering their numbers, but that effectiveness dropped off dramatically when opposed—which the demons constantly were. To battle them, the people of this world wielded magic and cooperation. They even summoned heroes from other worlds. And that was why, up until now, the demons had always been kept at bay, exiled to their own corner of the world. They were mounting a considerable offensive now, yet they still single-mindedly attacked with such simple honesty.</p>

      <p><em>It’s almost like...</em></p>

      <p>Yes, it was like they were saying that they wanted to be killed. In spite of the fact that their opponents took countermeasures against them, all they did was wield the same old-fashioned fossil of a fighting style they always had. It was like they were rushing towards their own deaths.</p>

      <p>Suimei incidentally recalled the famous hoax involving animals that committed mass suicide. It was anecdotally said that lemmings would strangely form groups and, one after the other, throw themselves off cliffs into the ocean to drown. This didn’t actually happen, of course, but it’s what he felt like he was watching.</p>

      <p><em>Unless the demons’ attacks are so monotonous in order to lure their opponents into carelessness... But there’s no payoff to that. The stages they could put that to use in are severely limited, and it’s not like losing all these small battles is going to secretly win them the war. I may just be overthinking things, or perhaps their goal is something else altogether...</em></p>

      <p>While fighting back the demons, Suimei gradually fell yet deeper into thought. The way he saw it, it was entirely possible that the main demon force attacking the Empire was a decoy, and another force was sneaking under their noses to attack a different location. Since the demons were now active in the Empire and the Alliance, if a detachment was dispatched, it would likely be headed for Astel. But the losses they were taking to do that seemed to outweigh any possible benefit they would reap from it.</p>

      <p>Certainly, during the chaos when Astel was forced to accept refugees from other fallen nations to the north, it was the right time to attack, but still... It would be extending their forces far too much. A detachment like that would also be out of the reach of their supply line.</p>

      <p>Just what <em>were</em> they planning? No, maybe there wasn’t anything in particular at all. Falling deeper into thought, Suimei grew a little slow, and the encirclement of demons around him grew thicker. Their annoying chattering interrupted his train of thought, however, so Suimei began a chant to shut them up. But before he could finish it, the entire mob of demons was blown away.</p>

      <p>It was like they were grasped by a gigantic invisible hand and crushed. And then Suimei saw it happen for himself. He spotted three glassy spheres of mana that reflected the images of demons within them. Tolerating no resistance, it mercilessly crushed them. Suimei turned around and glared at the man who’d appeared behind him, firing off a pointed question with a sharp tongue.</p>

      <p>“What are you up to?”</p>

      <p>“Nothing. They were gathered in such a nice formation, so I took care of them.”</p>

      <p>The man Suimei turned to had silver horns and was standing in the middle of a pool of demon blood and meat. He wore white vestments similar to traditional Japanese clothing that left his chest exposed. He had a glossy, black rosary-like necklace hanging around his neck. His face always wore the same fearless smile, like he found everything in the world to his pleasure and intended to spread that cheer. It was almost uncanny seeing him standing in the bloodbath of his own making like that. He was like the very avatar of battle—the dragonnewt of the Universal Apostles, Eanru.</p>

      <p>Stifling a laugh, Eanru drew nearer. He didn’t seem to see the demons around him. Or perhaps he just didn’t care. It was like he was blind to any sense of danger, but Suimei was the same way.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s a little early for a rematch though...”</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? There’s no early or late when it comes to fighting, right? As long there are two opponents, whether it be at the ends of the earth or the end of time, they’re destined to fight wherever they meet.”</p>

      <p>“To turn a reunion into a fight... Are you a member of the Maeda clan or something?”</p>

      <p>Suimei sighed in exasperation, and Eanru unfurled his bloodlust to get him to change his tune. Even surrounded by an enemy army, he was seriously preparing himself for a rematch. It was true that their conflict had no set time and place. But even so, getting into it here and now was far too capricious.</p>

      <p>Though for a battle-dominating dragonnewt, even concerns like environment were but trifling matters. Demons were a dime a dozen to him, and certainly wouldn’t get in the way while he was fighting Suimei. And even Suimei was staring to think the same. The moment rivals encountered each other, any stage could be an arena.</p>

      <p>The atmosphere gradually began screaming. The demons who weren’t stopped by Suimei’s flames were no longer moving. They were beings who knew nothing of fear, but between Suimei’s mana and Eanru’s fighting spirit clashing against each other, they were physically bound in place.</p>
    

      <p>“Your Royal Highness, that is an ally. But do note that it is only a temporary one...”</p>

      <p>“Temporary?”</p>

      <p>“Well, yeah.”</p>

      <p>The one to reply to Titania was the petite girl Felmenia called an ally. She must have heard their conversation. She then thrust her halberd towards Reiji and Titania.</p>

      <p>“Yo, Hero of Salvation and Twilight Beheading Princess. The name’s Jillbert Griga. Just for today, I’ll be lending ya a teensy hand, alright? Ah, also, I won’t be answering annoying questions like ‘Why?’ or ‘What’s your aim?’ You got that? And that’s ’cause they’re all things there’s no point in you knowing! Now, take this!”</p>

      <p>After declaring that, she once more swung her halberd and separated the axe blade from the shaft. Extending the chain that linked them together, she began to scatter the remaining demons in a circle around them.</p>

      <p>Along with Felmenia’s magic, almost all the demons in the area were now defeated or left powerless. The only one gnashing their teeth in response to that was, naturally, Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“Th-That many, by just the two of you...”</p>

      <p>“Hah! You’re naive for thinking you can just drag along a mishmash of these damn powerless pests! Don’t look down on humans, stupid! Idiot! Ah, but I’m a dwarf, though...”</p>

      <p>“Besides, it is not just our power. There are the imperial soldiers here as well.”</p>

      <p>As Felmenia glanced behind her, Graziella had already pulled together the soldiers, and they were exterminating the remaining demons.</p>

      <p>“Everyone, show some spirit! We’re going to support Reiji!”</p>

      <p>“HAH!”</p>

      <p>As Graziella gave her orders, the imperial soldiers shouted back in unison. They were thrown into chaos and left at a disadvantage, but from the looks of it, they quickly rearranged their position and were now pushing back the ambush.</p>

      <p>However, it could be said that what granted them a means of survival was, without a doubt, Felmenia’s magic. As Grallajearus also seemed to fully understand that fact, it fired off the pebbles of Isa towards her with rage.</p>

      <p>“You damn little girl!”</p>

      <p>“Oh barrier. Deploy.”</p>

      <p>In response, Felmenia muttered out a chant. And immediately, a thick wall of mana appeared before her and obstructed the countless iron scraps sent flying by Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“A magic shield cannot stand before our pebbles of Isa!”</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately for you, this is a barrier.”</p>

      <p>“Nonsense!”</p>

      <p>After that, the pebbles of Isa poured out relentlessly, but the barrier put up by Felmenia didn’t falter. Despite the fact that the wall of earth Reiji used crumbled in an instant, Felmenia had, with a far shorter chant, using a spell he had never heard before, and with no keyword, created a shield that could withstand it.</p>

      <p>Before long, Grallajearus could tell that the pebbles of Isa would not work, and stopped the barrage. And as he did, Felmenia’s barrier also vanished.</p>

      <p>“Demon general. That sort of attack will not work on me. Resign yourself.”</p>

      <p>“Gu...! This kind of...”</p>

      <p>Felmenia further increased the mana clad around her and threatened the demon with overwhelming pressure. Seeing her like that, Titania let out her admiration with a smile.</p>

      <p>“As expected, White Flame-dono is quite reliable.”</p>

      <p>“N-No, it wasn’t much...”</p>

      <p>In a complete change from her dreadful aura just now, Felmenia began to feel embarrassed. Her expression crumbled before the praise and admiration from the princess of her own country. However the mana she was accumulating remained the same, and she didn’t show any signs of carelessness. Before long, Graziella had finished cleaning up the remaining demons and joined up with them.</p>

      <p>“Is all that’s left that monster?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. A demon general that called itself Grallajearus.”</p>

      <p>Titania answered her. Perhaps because of the battle, her tone was somewhat gloomy, but Graziella responded with a fearless laugh.</p>

      <p>“With this much power gathered together, it doesn’t matter if it’s a demon general...”</p>

      <p>“Your Imperial Highness, it is still dangerous to be so careless.”</p>

      <p>“I know that much without you telling me. Right, Reiji... Reiji?”</p>

      <p>Though Graziella called out to him, Reiji didn’t respond. And as she was baffled by his unexpected behavior, Reiji suddenly stepped towards Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-sama?!”</p>

      <p>“Hey! What are you being so impudent for?!”</p>

      <p>The two princesses began panicking as Reiji stepped in on his own. Though they tried to restrain him as they called out, Reiji did not turn to look at them.</p>

      <p>“I will defeat this guy on my own. I want all of you to stay out of it.”</p>

      <p>“But Reiji-sama—”</p>

      <p>“I have to do this on my own.”</p>

      <p>Reiji ignored Titania’s voice. He had to do it himself. His resolve was the result of how the tide of this battle had gone. Because he felt worthless for having decided to cast away Titania as a sacrifice so he could flee. In order to climb over this wall, he had to do this on his own.</p>

      <p>Despite seeing his determined silhouette, Titania still insisted on stopping him. But before she could, Jillbert thrust out her halberd to stop her.</p>

      <p>“Let him do it. Everyone feels like they got to do it themselves once in a while.”</p>

      <p>“What are you...?”</p>

      <p>“It’s a ritual. For a man to become a warrior, right? You’re also one of those types, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p>Saying that, Jillbert winked and smiled at Titania. It was true that one had to stand firm to become a warrior, so Titania was unable to say anything back. As Reiji stepped forward on his path to becoming a man, Grallajearus started making an uproar.</p>

      <p>“You’ll defeat us all on your own, you say? It was already proven that your pitiful power is not enough to defeat us! Are you touched in the head?!”</p>

      <p>“I haven’t gone crazy or anything. It’s just because... this is what I must do. So I will do it.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t get carried away, you damn brat! Have you mistaken the power given to you by the goddess as your own strength?!”</p>

      <p>“I know full well that this is a temporary power that I was given. That’s why... That’s exactly why! I need to surpass my limits!”</p>

      <p>“Are you saying we’re your damn stepping stone or something?!”</p>

      <p>“That’s right! I will defeat you and step over that boundary!”</p>

      <p>With a roar, Reiji advanced towards Grallajearus. As he screamed, he dashed forward for the sake of surpassing that wall. As he drew closer, the pebbles of Isa were fired out in a flash. And Reiji began evading them as he circled around Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“After howling so vigorously, is all you can do evade, HEROOOOO?!”</p>

      <p>“Ugh...”</p>

      <p>A pebble of Isa grazed Reiji’s face and left a cut on his cheek. He stepped forward with conviction, but as if he was being toyed with, it took all his effort just to keep moving. He couldn’t spot any opening in which to attack, let alone to attain victory. No, that kind of thing never existed in the first place. With just the fact that he had rushed into a hard fight, any hope of victory had been wiped out.</p>

      <p>But even so, Reiji had to climb that wall. Even if it was reckless, even if it was foolish. He was pushed back by Rajas, Elliot took it easy on him, he was completely subdued by Ilzarl... Even here and now, he was completely outclassed. He couldn’t just resign himself to being such a half-baked hero from here on out.</p>

      <p>That was because he had companions he could rely on. Even now, they were behind him, calling out to him in concern. Let’s cooperate and defeat it. Don’t be reckless. All he heard were kind voices.</p>

      <p>He was always being saved like that by someone. But was that really what a hero was? Was it really okay for him to call himself a hero like that? Without saving anyone, while only being saved himself? Only to be placed on a pedestal and carried above others like a buffoon?</p>

      <p>He could not accept that. Ever. Being a flashy showpiece and nothing more held no meaning. There was no way he could accept such deception.</p>

      <p>“I won’t lose!”</p>

      <p>“For the sake of the Goddess?! Or perhaps for the sake of the people?!”</p>

      <p>“Wrong! It has nothing to do with heroes, goddesses, or the people of this world! It’s all for myself!”</p>

      <p>That was why. That was exactly why. The time to take a great stride was now. Up until now, he remained the same and took advantage of the good will of his companions. But it was time to separate himself from that dependence.</p>

      <p>Even if he couldn’t fly, as long as he never took the leap on his own, he would never learn it for himself. That was why he had to step forward now. That was why—</p>

      <p>“I will... I will become stronger! I want to become stronger!”</p>

      <p>His thoughts, his desires, he yelled them all at himself, and just at that time...</p>

      <p><em>If you desire it, then request it and call out.</em></p>

      <p>“Huh...?”</p>

      <p><em>The final gate that connects to a great power at all times exists within you.</em></p>

      <p>“Wh-Who...”</p>

      <p>As a robotic pronouncement suddenly resounded in his head, Reiji unexpectedly raised his voice to question it. And when he realized this, he was standing all alone in the middle of a mud-like darkness.</p>

      <p>“Wh-What? Where? Wh-Why...?”</p>

      <p>As a baffling situation presented itself around him, Reiji was seized by surprise. He was definitely in the military encampment of the imperial army, and was right in front of Grallajearus. And in spite of that, he couldn’t see those things anywhere. They were nowhere to be found. Everywhere he looked, there was only darkness, and something which looked like a light far in the distance.</p>

      <p>However, all of that was gone in a flash. That was because the small light in the depths of the darkness became bluer and bluer...</p>

      <p>“Ah...”</p>

      <p>As if entranced by the distant sparkling blue light, an enraptured voice came out of his mouth without him realizing. His mind was the same as that enraptured voice, simply dumbfounded. That passion with which he was denying himself as he yelled was wiped away, and all that remained was that blue light.</p>

      <p>He had seen that light before. It was none other than the light given off by the gem installed in the Sacrament.</p>

      <p>And in that instant, he suddenly understood. That light was something that he had to head towards no matter what. Beyond that light, the answer to everything was awaiting him.</p>

      <p>That’s why he broke into a run. He ran and ran, with all his strength to grasp that blue light.</p>

      <p>And immediately, words appeared in his head. A voice with no voice, and that was...</p>

      <p><em>By my Lapis’s blue brilliance, crystallize the sword spirit.</em></p>

      <p>And as those words repeated, the blue light grew stronger. And as that light spread, it gathered in his hand—but before he could hear the last words, the dazzling light vanished.</p>

      <p>When he came to, that tunnel of darkness and the blue light were no longer there, and the scenery returned to that of the imperial military encampment. And before his eyes, Grallajearus was sneering.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. Just as I was wondering what you were doing, all that did was give off a bit of light.”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>If it was as it said, Reiji was likely giving off a blue light just now. In his right hand, he was suddenly gripping the Ishar Cluster. He had unconsciously grabbed it, or perhaps the blue light he was grasping was, in fact, the Sacrament itself.</p>

      <p>As the Sacrament continued to give off a pale light, it was like he was staring at the trailing memory of that blue light. If it was just as Grallajearus said, all it did was give off light. He was probably just standing there as a blue light overflowed from his hand. As proof of that, unlike the time he fought Ilzarl, the Sacrament didn’t turn into a weapon. Because he couldn’t hear those last words to manifest the weapon, this was only a natural deduction.</p>

      <p>However, even so, he was still able to grasp that blue light. He could see the path. He could see the door. He could hear the mysteries of that blue light, the voice with no voice. Therefore, the amount of power he grasped—it wasn’t zero.</p>

      <p>“Wha—?!”</p>

      <p>Grasping his orichalcum sword once more, he moved with the same speed which overwhelmed Ilzarl, and he could hear a chorus of shock in front of him. It was likely that it looked like he had vanished before its many eyes.</p>

      <p>This demon general wasn’t stronger than Ilzarl. In every respect, it was inferior. It was remarkably inferior. If Reiji was going to lose against such an opponent, his suffering from this point would be unfathomable. That was why—</p>

      <p>The number of times he could deceive its eyes was only this once. Winning against an enemy like this from straight on was truly a victory suitable of praise.</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>One step. With one step, in complete silence, he swung his orichalcum sword. Repelling the pebbles, which flew like bullets. Trampling the earth under his feet. With that tenacious single step, his boot sank into the ground, and the ground around his boot swelled up like goosebumps.</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>As he drew close, Grallajearus’s voice couldn’t be heard. He could no longer hear anything. It was raising an uproar, but Reiji no longer perceived it as sound. Its words of disbelief and protest didn’t even reach his ears. His blood had run cold from being pushed back by this opponent only a moment ago, but now Reiji understood the ultimate reality. However, there was not a particle of happiness in him. He did not step forward in order to gain a sense of superiority.</p>

      <p>The demon general was only a few more steps away. It was in range, if he thrust out his sword. At that distance, the demon general abandoned hope and poorly fired out the pebbles of Isa in desperation. But it was too slow. Before they were even fired, Reiji could see through all of it, and the march to victory was determined before it even began. As he drew closer with his sword at the ready, Grallajearus screamed.</p>

      <p>“We are legion! Know that an attack from a sword is meaningless before us!”</p>

      <p>He could hear angry voices. No, there was a small of amount of bluffing mixed in. Having fallen into an inferior position, it relied on bravado to cheer itself on. Like it had declared, the fact that it was an army was a nuisance. However.</p>

      <p>“Is that so?”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“Even if you are a legion, the fact that you share a single consciousness means that there must be some sort of source which houses that consciousness. If there wasn’t, you would just be a disconnected mess of chaos. Isn’t that right?”</p>

      <p>As the truth was revealed before it, Grallajearus’s voice became filled with panic.</p>

      <p>“Wh-Why do you... Why do you know that?!”</p>

      <p>“Light...”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>“That blue light told me.”</p>

      <p>What gave him that idea was the blue light. When he touched that blue light, the voice with no voice whispered it to him. ‘That is definitely an opponent you can defeat...’</p>

      <p>And so, as Reiji unerringly swung downwards, he slashed apart the small vital core deep within Grallajearus.</p>

      <p class="centerp section-marking">★</p>

      <p>Around the same time that Reiji and Titania’s fight against Grallajearus and Lefille’s fight with Latora started...</p>

      <p>After distancing himself from the main encampment, Suimei was clashing with demons about halfway to Lefille’s position.</p>

      <p>“O flammae, legito. Pro venefici doloris clamore.”</p>

      <p><em>[Oh flames, assemble. Like the cry of the magician’s resentment.]</em></p>

      <p>Following his chant, Suimei unleashed Ashurbanipal’s flame upon the swarm of incoming demons. Based on a curse from Assyrian legend, it was fire magicka that was remarkably efficient against living creatures. At the start of the chant, it formed several small magicka circles at odd intervals in the air. And as the chant progressed, a sphere of fire formed in the center of them all. It burned like it had a shining stone at its core, and was obviously no normal fire. Dense flames then shot out of the smaller magicka circles to incinerate their targets. A conflagration danced its way through the crowd of demons. The demons caught in it were denied the chance to even scream before they crumbled to the ground as ash.</p>

      <p>So even if he was outnumbered, Suimei clearly wasn’t hurting for firepower. Yet nevertheless, the demons didn’t falter in their charge towards him. It was like they were machines that knew nothing of adaptability, devoted to one single pre-programmed command.</p>

      <p>Suimei was currently moving against the demon army on his own. His plan was more or less “search and destroy.” A few days had passed since the test matches at the encampment, and after the imperial army had established its foothold in this battle, Reiji’s companions were finally allowed to join the fight. In a private conversation with Reanat, Suimei had asked if there were demons traveling along any paths that weren’t booby trapped. Reanat had said there were, so Suimei had asked to take care of those. Of course, since he was working alone, he’d added the caveat, “To the extent that I can.”</p>

      <p>“Originally, I planned to get paid for this, but it isn’t too bad if I think of it as doing a favor to lessen the burden on Lefille and Reiji, really.”</p>

      <p>Before heading out, Suimei had made that declaration at the encampment. In his world, the work of magicians came at a high price, so it was perfectly natural for him to think about compensation when lending a hand. But this time, there were also his companions to think about, as well as the fact that he was being supplied with food and any other provisions he needed. In light of that, he tried to think of this as an exchange of sorts.</p>

      <p>Of course, he also thought it would be perfectly reasonable if he didn’t stick his neck out at all. For the time being, in order to keep Reiji from suspecting anything, he was supposedly assisting Lefille’s unit. He’d departed with them, but then parted ways with them in order to move on his own.</p>

      <p>Spreading out a map and confirming the position of the stars, he determined where he was and where the units sent out to stall the demons were. Avoiding them and the paths that the imperial troops were using, he strengthened his body with magicka and made his way through the treacherous mountain terrain, practically skipping and humming until he came across a force of demons.</p>

      <p>There were easily two hundred of them, all of which were moving on foot. An infantry unit, it seemed, advancing through the forest in a single clump. Mowing down trees as they pressed forward like they owned the place, they looked just like a giant caterpillar devouring a leaf as it moved across it.</p>

      <p>And unlike the mostly humanoid demons that so often appeared in fantasy stories, these were much closer to beasts and insects. They had large builds twice the size of even the tallest basketball players. They had exoskeletons covered in pitch black cuticle, which looked as hard as rock. Like they were talking amongst themselves, their spidery mandibles were clattering ominously.</p>

      <p>“Ugeh...”</p>

      <p>They inspired an unrivaled feeling of revulsion in Suimei. Compared to them, the demons he’d met before were much easier on the eyes. Their external appearance was much more put together than these creepy ones. Suimei found them absolutely revolting and unconsciously expressed his disgust with a groan. But now that he’d found them, he had to do something about them. He was at the crossroads of deciding how to proceed.</p>

      <p>Should he annihilate them? Or should he just deal a devastating blow to the group and then retreat? With this many of them, two or three grand magickas would take care of the whole lot. But thinking about it from the perspective of the strategy the Empire was putting into play, it would be fine if he didn’t go that far. All he really had to do was stall them and, if the circumstances permitted, take a few of them out before reporting back. However...</p>

      <p><em>Considering what’s to come...</em></p>

      <p>Suimei’s sudden anxiety wasn’t about the fight before him, but about himself. He had no misgivings about throwing down with the demons, but right now, they weren’t the only shadow looming over him.</p>

      <p>His biggest concern was the Universal Apostles, Eanru’s group led by the mirage man. He genuinely and truly considered them a serious threat. There was Eanru’s sheer physical strength, not to mention the talent the mirage man had displayed with his magicka. Thinking about his inevitable conflict with them, Suimei knew he had to fight and grow stronger. Next time, he wanted to be able to stand up to them.</p>

      <p>“That’s why... Well, I know I need to sharpen my battle senses, but...”</p>

      <p>It just seemed like a poor plan to simply throw himself into the middle of a demon army for that. A magician had to fight like a magician. There was nothing to be gained from recklessly rushing into battle. Moreover, the goal he was chasing was vague.</p>

      <p>But, with things as they stood, he felt pressured to take on this reckless, vague challenge. He wasn’t happy with the way he was, and he wanted to change that. If he simply stood still, the day would again come where he would be smeared across the earth.</p>

      <p>Reaffirming the determination in his heart, Suimei jumped out from the shadow of a tree. The demons immediately raised their ear-grating voices as they rushed towards him. They wanted to tear apart his weak human body with their claws and sharp insectoid mouthpieces.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t just their strength they were relying on. What made them the most dangerous was the dark power surrounding their bodies. It was like a mysterious, sinister aura. Different from the negative powers behind dark magic, it was the power that drew from the Evil God as a source. If someone who didn’t posses the Goddess’s protection took a blow from that to their bare flesh, it wouldn’t end with a simple wound.</p>

      <p>“However...”</p>

      <p>However, just what was there that he had to fear about that? Certainly, the Evil God’s power was astounding. Almost all deific power was. But compared to all of the other fights he’d been through before this day, it didn’t scare him. He’d fought far worse, and frequently, at that.</p>

      <p>Naturally, those were fights against wielders of mystical powers. But really, it could be said that even the most common fights in his world surpassed those here. In the modern world, almost all fighting was carried out with technology and military tactics that made full use of it. Machine guns that could fire a hail of bullets. Anti-tank grenades like the RPG-7 that granted a single human terrifying destructive potential. Flying at mach 2, anti-ship missiles that could accurately strike from two kilometers away, not to mention the missile cruisers that housed them. Assault helicopters like the Super Hind that could gun down humans from the sky.</p>

      <p>Remembering his fights against such things, just how could fighting against demons even compare? Recalling fighting opponents with attacks that came in near the speed of sound from unknown locations, the threat of an attack he could see right in front of him was nearly laughable. He could probably handle this with one hand tied behind his back, if not both.</p>

      <p>Dodging the strike coming straight at him from the front and defending against the claws swinging in from the side with magicka, he returned the attack with fire magicka. As the rest of the demons closed in, he blew away the ground beneath them as he jumped into the air.</p>

      <p>“O flammae, legito. Pro venefici doloris clamore. Parito colluctatione et aestuato. Deferto impedimentum fatum atrox.”</p>

      <p><em>[Oh flames, assemble. Like the cry of the magician’s resentment. Give form to death’s agony and burst into flames. Bestow the one who obstructs me with a dreadful destiny.]</em></p>

      <p>Under the clear blue sky, Suimei’s chant brought about a burst of fire in the forest. White smoke from all the incinerated demon flesh rose into the air, and the earth was bathed in red. It was like the scenery of a nightmare. Below that refreshing blue sky that would calm anybody’s heart, a banquet of burning hell was unfolding. That impression didn’t seem to change no matter how many times he witnessed it. Knitting his brow at the screams and carnage, Suimei indulged himself in idle thoughts for a moment.</p>

      <p><em>In any case, what does it mean that the demons move in such monotonous, predictable ways?</em></p>

      <p>What came to mind was something he’d been curious about for quite a while now. From what Suimei had seen to date, the demons fought using the singular strategy of trying to push straight into human territory. Even when Vuishta caught Hatsumi in his scheme, the main force of the demon army was still just charging straight forward in a frontal attack.</p>

      <p>The demons would take up formations with tactless simplicity, but they hardly relied on strategy. Their only tactics were to move forward using brute force to overcome. It was arguably an effective tactic considering their numbers, but that effectiveness dropped off dramatically when opposed—which the demons constantly were. To battle them, the people of this world wielded magic and cooperation. They even summoned heroes from other worlds. And that was why, up until now, the demons had always been kept at bay, exiled to their own corner of the world. They were mounting a considerable offensive now, yet they still single-mindedly attacked with such simple honesty.</p>

      <p><em>It’s almost like...</em></p>

      <p>Yes, it was like they were saying that they wanted to be killed. In spite of the fact that their opponents took countermeasures against them, all they did was wield the same old-fashioned fossil of a fighting style they always had. It was like they were rushing towards their own deaths.</p>

      <p>Suimei incidentally recalled the famous hoax involving animals that committed mass suicide. It was anecdotally said that lemmings would strangely form groups and, one after the other, throw themselves off cliffs into the ocean to drown. This didn’t actually happen, of course, but it’s what he felt like he was watching.</p>

      <p><em>Unless the demons’ attacks are so monotonous in order to lure their opponents into carelessness... But there’s no payoff to that. The stages they could put that to use in are severely limited, and it’s not like losing all these small battles is going to secretly win them the war. I may just be overthinking things, or perhaps their goal is something else altogether...</em></p>

      <p>While fighting back the demons, Suimei gradually fell yet deeper into thought. The way he saw it, it was entirely possible that the main demon force attacking the Empire was a decoy, and another force was sneaking under their noses to attack a different location. Since the demons were now active in the Empire and the Alliance, if a detachment was dispatched, it would likely be headed for Astel. But the losses they were taking to do that seemed to outweigh any possible benefit they would reap from it.</p>

      <p>Certainly, during the chaos when Astel was forced to accept refugees from other fallen nations to the north, it was the right time to attack, but still... It would be extending their forces far too much. A detachment like that would also be out of the reach of their supply line.</p>

      <p>Just what <em>were</em> they planning? No, maybe there wasn’t anything in particular at all. Falling deeper into thought, Suimei grew a little slow, and the encirclement of demons around him grew thicker. Their annoying chattering interrupted his train of thought, however, so Suimei began a chant to shut them up. But before he could finish it, the entire mob of demons was blown away.</p>

      <p>It was like they were grasped by a gigantic invisible hand and crushed. And then Suimei saw it happen for himself. He spotted three glassy spheres of mana that reflected the images of demons within them. Tolerating no resistance, it mercilessly crushed them. Suimei turned around and glared at the man who’d appeared behind him, firing off a pointed question with a sharp tongue.</p>

      <p>“What are you up to?”</p>

      <p>“Nothing. They were gathered in such a nice formation, so I took care of them.”</p>

      <p>The man Suimei turned to had silver horns and was standing in the middle of a pool of demon blood and meat. He wore white vestments similar to traditional Japanese clothing that left his chest exposed. He had a glossy, black rosary-like necklace hanging around his neck. His face always wore the same fearless smile, like he found everything in the world to his pleasure and intended to spread that cheer. It was almost uncanny seeing him standing in the bloodbath of his own making like that. He was like the very avatar of battle—the dragonnewt of the Universal Apostles, Eanru.</p>

      <p>Stifling a laugh, Eanru drew nearer. He didn’t seem to see the demons around him. Or perhaps he just didn’t care. It was like he was blind to any sense of danger, but Suimei was the same way.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s a little early for a rematch though...”</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? There’s no early or late when it comes to fighting, right? As long there are two opponents, whether it be at the ends of the earth or the end of time, they’re destined to fight wherever they meet.”</p>

      <p>“To turn a reunion into a fight... Are you a member of the Maeda clan or something?”</p>

      <p>Suimei sighed in exasperation, and Eanru unfurled his bloodlust to get him to change his tune. Even surrounded by an enemy army, he was seriously preparing himself for a rematch. It was true that their conflict had no set time and place. But even so, getting into it here and now was far too capricious.</p>

      <p>Though for a battle-dominating dragonnewt, even concerns like environment were but trifling matters. Demons were a dime a dozen to him, and certainly wouldn’t get in the way while he was fighting Suimei. And even Suimei was staring to think the same. The moment rivals encountered each other, any stage could be an arena.</p>

      <p>The atmosphere gradually began screaming. The demons who weren’t stopped by Suimei’s flames were no longer moving. They were beings who knew nothing of fear, but between Suimei’s mana and Eanru’s fighting spirit clashing against each other, they were physically bound in place.</p>
