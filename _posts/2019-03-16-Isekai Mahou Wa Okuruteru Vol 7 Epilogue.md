      <h1>Epilogue: The Greed of Ten</h1>

      <p>The battle with the demons came to an end, and the calm atmosphere of the imperial headquarters that was there before the surprise attack had started to return.</p>

      <p>Because they still had to clean up, most of the people there were still moving about restlessly, but the chaos and danger from the bloodlust in the air had already vanished.</p>

      <p>Since the leaders of the Empire and the main force were in fairly good health, they hadn’t suffered any major casualties. The soldiers began to collect themselves quickly, and Felmenia’s efforts and Reiji’s fighting style were all quite effective.</p>

      <p>And so, by the overwhelming power Reiji wielded, the defeated demon general, Grallajearus, was captured alive. The core which tied its many consciousnesses together had been cut by Reiji’s sword, and its body had half collapsed, but it was left alive to be interrogated.</p>

      <p>It could be said that Reiji was not gripped by the need to kill, and proof of that was seen in his reasoning for capturing the demon general. Creating a wall of soldiers around the back of main large tent, it was clear that escape or resistance for their prisoner would not be permitted. Despite Reiji’s strike, which should have been impossible in the first place, the defensive measures put in place were mostly just a precaution. Naturally, Reiji and the others were standing at the head of the wall of soldiers, and Reiji had his sword thrust forward. Coming through the crowd, Reanat stepped forward. It seemed his orders to the other groups had finally ended. Gorgan and the other members of the Elite Twelve were together with him, ensuring his safety. He then spoke to Grallajearus.</p>

      <p>“Demon general. Why were you able to strike at our rear?”</p>

      <p>“Do you bastards think... we would say anything... that would benefit you...?”</p>

      <p>“So it seems. There is no way you would just honestly answer, is there? I suppose in that case, it just means we will have to hear it by force.”</p>

      <p>As Reanat raised his hand overhead, the Elite Twelve began moving. And just as he said, they began hurting it, and were likely preparing to torture it. However, even in that vortex of pain, Grallajearus poured out scorn in a feeble voice as it wheezed.</p>

      <p>“Demon general, what is so laughable?”</p>

      <p>“It’s funny... Isn’t it obvious... that it’s funny? To think that we would give you information, just from pain... You bastard humans are truly... truly foolish...”</p>

      <p>With a sardonic laugh, it showed its intent that it wouldn’t give in. As Grallajearus continued to let out laughter, Jillbert, who had been listening nearby, cut into their conversation.</p>

      <p>“Isn’t it pointless to ask that kinda thing? Those demons are beings who think in a different way from us, after all. Even if you threaten them with violence and torture them, they won’t say anything. Fundamentally, they don’t know the concept of holding one’s life dear.”</p>

      <p>“That’s right! To grant the dearest wish of Evil God Zekaraia, to build up the honor of Demon Lord Nakshatra, that is the way of us demons! We fear neither pain nor death!”</p>

      <p>After letting out a loud shout, a chorus of laughter rang out. That shrill noise was certainly none other than the mad laugh of one on the verge of death. An interrogation was useless. In that case, there was only one thing to do. Just as Reanat looked towards Reiji asking him to finish it off...</p>

      <p>“That’s obvious. If it wasn’t the case, they would be more worthless than trash.”</p>

      <p>A voice came out of nowhere. It was a voice far more severe than even the rigorous climate of this northern imperial territory. It wasn’t immediately clear whether it was a man or woman’s voice. It had a certain beauty to it. And if it hadn’t spoken such harsh words, it would have been very delightful to listen to. However, that beautiful voice was one Reiji’s party had heard before. No, there was no way they would forget.</p>

      <p>“That voice is...”</p>

      <p>“It couldn’t be!”</p>

      <p>Forgetting he had a sword pointed at Grallajearus, both Reiji and Titania raised their voices as they looked towards the source of the voice. And standing there, with long white hair and the deep red eyes of a fierce god, was Ilzarl.</p>

      <p>“You’re...”</p>

      <p>“It has been a while, hero. To think that you would defeat Grallajearus. It exceeded my expectations, don’t you know?”</p>

      <p>Ilzarl’s baffling statement made it sound as if he was delighted over the defeat of his ally. However, Reiji had different concerns...</p>

      <p>“You were watching?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I was spectating. From the very beginning.”</p>

      <p>Softly, but with a clearly joyful look, he began laughing. On the other hand, wondering just who Ilzarl was, Reanat turned to Graziella.</p>

      <p>“Lyla, who is...?”</p>

      <p>“A demon general. A powerful one...”</p>

      <p>“That is a demon...?”</p>

      <p>His bewilderment was likely due to the fact that Ilzarl looked more human than demon. Reanat, the Elite Twelve, and all the Imperial soldiers began to stir—however, at Graziella’s immediate command, they prepared their magic and drew their swords. And during that, one person stepped forward. It was the one who was able to compete with Ilzarl back in the Self Governed State, Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“To think you would once more show your face before me, demi-ogre.”</p>

      <p>“You have quite the mouth as always, little girl. I will devour you later, so wait there for now.”</p>

      <p>As Io Kuzami and Ilzarl were having their little exchange...</p>

      <p>“Is it about time that I come out?”</p>

      <p>Another voice rang out from nowhere. As they wondered where that voice was coming from, a demon casually appeared from Ilzarl’s shadow. He had blonde hair and bangs lightly hanging over his forehead and a slender face. Complete with a gloomy atmosphere, he appeared to quite closely resemble a human, but he had strange horns on his head and a dark power hanging over him. He was definitely a demon. And as that demon came out, it suddenly took on rather gentlemanly behavior and bowed down.</p>

      <p>“For the present, allow me to offer you my congratulations. Hero from the Kingdom of Astel, Reiji Shana. To have reached the blue radiance beyond the distance that you so desired, allow me to give my heartfelt pleasure at the good news.”</p>

      <p>“Why do you—”</p>

      <p>Know my name, and about the blue radiance. As Reiji was about to ask that, the demon who appeared from the shadow cut him off.</p>

      <p>“Aah, I seem to have forgotten my manners. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lishbaum. I am not a demon general, but I am being allowed to fulfill a similar role. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”</p>

      <p>As he spoke with excessive politeness that one would never use with one’s enemies, Lishbaum smoothly introduced himself. Reiji couldn’t tell if he was just showing off his composed attitude, simply had the free time to introduce himself, or the situation itself was just worthless to him.</p>

      <p>“Ilzarl, Lishbaum, why now of all times...?!”</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the one to speak up was Grallajearus. There was definitely anger in its voice as it criticized them for arriving so late. However, Ilzarl paid it no mind.</p>

      <p>“Grallajearus. Do you resent us for not coming to save you? How foolish. To shift the sin of being too weak onto others, it’s far too gutless an attitude for a demon general to take.”</p>

      <p>“Bastard... You’re saying you’re different from us?”</p>

      <p>“Of course. I am not born of the Evil God. It just means my way of thinking is different.”</p>

      <p>While Ilzarl and Grallajearus were having a little dispute, Graziella shouted out.</p>

      <p>“Everyone take your positions! These are not enemies to be underestimated!”</p>

      <p>The soldiers were already prepared for battle, but after receiving Graziella’s command, they knew not to carelessly move. There were two enemies on the level of demon generals before them. Furthermore, they had just finished going through a difficult battle.</p>

      <p>“Mere offerings, you want to have a go?”</p>

      <p>As Ilzarl fearlessly pointed his fangs at them, Reiji yelled back.</p>

      <p>“It won’t go like last time!”</p>

      <p>“Don’t get conceited just because you defeated Grallajearus. Well, that female mage and dwarf over there both seem like they’d be worth eating, though...”</p>

      <p>“I’m your opponent!”</p>

      <p>As Ilzarl focused on Felmenia and Jillbert, Reiji pointed his orichalcum sword at him. And just as the battle was about to start...</p>

      <p>“I don’t particularly mind going at it with you here, but— Hmm?”</p>

      <p>“Heh. A hindrance, is it—”</p>

      <p>Just as Ilzarl and Lishbaum seemed to notice something, they suddenly leaped back. And immediately following that, from the clear blue sky, a lightning-like flash struck the ground between Reiji and Ilzarl. A tremor occurred from the powerful strike, and a cloud of dust kicked up. And eventually, from within that dust, a single man with green hair and silver horns — Eanru, appeared.</p>

      <p>Seeing those white clothes which resembled traditional Japanese clothing, Jillbert suddenly yelled out in anger.</p>

      <p>“You damn dragonnewt! Why the hell did you come here?! This ain’t your damn post, you know?!”</p>

      <p>“Eh, it’s nothing. I ended up finishing up over there quickly, you see. I heard something interesting was going to happen, so I came running over. But to think it would be on this level, huh!”</p>

      <p>Saying that, Eanru’s fearless smile grew even more. It was like he struck gold. As Reiji and the others were completely confused by the appearance of someone they didn’t know, a voice they did recognize came running over.</p>

      <p>“Don’t just run off on your own, dammit!”</p>

      <p>“I found something interesting, so my reflex kicked in.”</p>

      <p>And in the direction Eanru was speaking, they could see Suimei’s figure. Seeing this, Reiji yelled towards him.</p>

      <p>“Suimei!”</p>

      <p>“Oh great, I just came back, and now it seems something outrageous is—”</p>

      <p>And just as Suimei was trying to talk, a powerful rage began swelling from the other side. It was coming from the direction that Reiji and the others were just confronting, from where the one who resembled a fierce god, Ilzarl, was standing.</p>

      <p>His bright eyes further flared up, and he let out a hair-raising pressure that shocked up everyone’s skin. And the one on the receiving end of that gaze filled with anger was definitely the green haired dragonnewt, Eanru.</p>

      <p>“Bastard, the Silver Dew...”</p>

      <p>“Ha, HAHAHAHAHA! How long it’s been! It’s truly been a long time, maneater! To think you’re still alive. Contrary to expectations, you’re quite tenacious! What? Did you have cold meals in the back regions of the north to survive?”</p>

      <p>This fierce god’s anger was matched with a pleasant laugh from Eanru. Seeing that attitude, the sound of Ilzarl grinding his teeth could be heard as he expressed his severe anger. As for Reiji and the others, seeing an opponent who held boundless composure against them break down in rage left them completely perplexed. After coming here, unknown people were just appearing on their own one after the other, so it couldn’t be helped that they were confused. In any case, as Eanru showed Ilzarl a ferocious smile.</p>

      <p>“How fortunate. To think I would be able to meet you. Though it is unexpected that you are together with those pests.”</p>

      <p>“I am also fortunate. I can finally return the debt that I owe you.”</p>

      <p>The two shot off sparks at each other. One was showing joy at their reunion—no, rematch—while the other was filled with rage while wiping aside his drool. From the way they were talking, they already knew each other well, and it was certain that there was some history between them. As their tremendous fighting spirits clashed against one another, Reiji casually called out to Suimei out of habit.</p>

      <p>“Suimei... Suimei?”</p>

      <p>He called out, but Suimei didn’t reply. As Reiji looked at him, he was simply staring at a single point. Reiji thought Suimei was bound in place by the terrifying collision of fighting spirit—but in truth, Suimei was completely ignoring it. Yes, because a far greater existence than those two was right before his eyes.</p>

      <p>“Is something the matter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Did something that unexpected happen?”</p>

      <p>Suddenly, a voice came out from nowhere, and Reiji and the others couldn’t tell who was speaking for a moment. All they could hear was a deep, cold, but youthful voice of a man. But Reiji remembered hearing that voice somewhere before. It hadn’t been all that long since he was just talking to the owner of that voice. Yes, the one who was talking was the demon named Lishbaum.</p>

      <p>“Why are you...”</p>

      <p>It was a puzzled and shocked mutter. Just as he said, it was a voice gripped by fear like he had seen a ghost. And the one who did so was none other than Suimei, who had completely stiffened up as he looked at Lishbaum.</p>

      <p>“Why are you here...? No, why are you alive... Kudrack the Ghosthide?”</p>

      <p>“Kudrack?”</p>

      <p>“Ghost...hide?”</p>

      <p>As Suimei said that name towards Lishbaum, both Reiji and Ilzarl reacted. They both knit their brows at the name they had never heard before. It was a completely different name from the one Lishbaum introduced himself to Reiji with. And with a completely different tone than when he spoke with Reiji, the deep and cold voice of the man rang out.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a long time, Yakagi Suimei. Shocked? I bet you must be. I should have been obliterated by you back then, after all.”</p>

      <p>As if satisfied by Suimei’s shocked face, Lishbaum let out a weak, stifled laugh. And in response...</p>

      <p>“...What does this mean? Why are you alive? Why do you have that form?”</p>

      <p>“That is the obvious question, isn’t it...? But unraveling it so simply just isn’t amusing.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t fucking joke around!”</p>

      <p>Suimei yelled strongly with wrath, but Lishbaum didn’t answer him. On the other hand, Ilzarl looked at Lishbaum with a skeptical gaze.</p>

      <p>“Lishbaum, is that offering a damn acquaintance of yours?”</p>

      <p>As Ilzarl asked, in a complete change, Lishbaum replied in an excessively polite tone like he did earlier.</p>

      <p>“Yes. That is the man who served as the trigger for me coming to this place.”</p>

      <p>“The trigger to bring you here, you say?”</p>

      <p>“Yes.”</p>

      <p>As Lishbaum nodded, Ilzarl couldn’t understand. On the other hand, Suimei’s anger increased from being ignored, and he let out an even louder voice than before.</p>

      <p>“Kudrack... Fucking answer me!”</p>

      <p>“Don’t be in such a rush, Starfall. It simply ended up that I’m fighting on the demons’ side. Isn’t that all you need to know? What else is there that you need other than that? The goal that I mean to achieve in battle... Don’t you already understand it completely?”</p>

      <p>That was certainly true. Suimei’s history with this man was deep, and he knew it well. Lishbaum’s, no, Kudrack the Ghosthide’s reason for fighting. No matter where he was or what he was doing, there was only one goal. In that case...</p>

      <p>“...Then why are you on the demons’ side fighting in such a poor way? If your goal is the same as it was before, just what the hell are you thinking, making them move like that? Are you seriously motivated?”</p>

      <p>“Of course I am. Now, just as before, my dearest wish has not changed.”</p>

      <p>“Then why...?”</p>

      <p>“Am I using tactics which pointlessly waste demons, is it? Let’s see. I’m certainly doing that. Surely, my actions right now must seem baffling to you.”</p>

      <p>In a complete change from his faint smile, Lishbaum began laughing gloomily with a shadow behind his words. And after calming down...</p>

      <p>“I guess it’s fine to unravel it here. It seems you’re not the only one who wants to hear it, after all.”</p>

      <p>Saying that, Lishbaum glanced over at Ilzarl and began explaining.</p>

      <p>“Starfall. I do believe you already know this, but the demons are a race born of the Evil God. Just like all divinity, the Evil God pressures other faiths antagonistically while increasing the number of pawns it has. And in building up its power to interfere with the world, it ever so gradually increases the number of its pawns even more. That could even be considered its job.”</p>

      <p>“You’re saying it’s the same as any other god?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. However, even if it does well in increasing its number of pawns, eventually a problem comes up. The pawns born of its weak power in the beginning are unable to keep up with the changes surrounding them. And gradually, they become more and more obsolete. But even if they create new ones, eventually the numbers cap out, and seats remain filled by the weaker, previously created ones. Then—”</p>

      <p><em>To improve that situation, just what should one do?</em></p>

      <p>Just from that one word, Suimei figured it all out, and shock appeared on his face as he muttered.</p>

      <p>“Wha— Then it’s not about increasing resources. You’re working to open up spots after reaching capacity...?”</p>

      <p>“That’s exactly it. So to speak, it’s like a strategy-type adventure game. At the beginning, you can only afford poor soldiers due to the low municipal and military levels. But as you progress in level, you can gather much better soldiers. Then, in that case, it’s just a matter of where to send those low level soldiers. It’s just the fate of useless demons is all.”</p>

      <p>Suimei continued to gaze in wonder at the lich. The fate of the demons. After saying so much, that answer wasn’t difficult to arrive at. In a strategy game, one would either just overwrite the data of those soldiers while in the city building part, or just send them on a suicide attack to free up space. But this wasn’t a game, it was reality. Even so, if that was being overlooked...</p>

      <p>“So they’re not your allies...”</p>

      <p>“Didn’t you already know? As I desire to purify the world, it’s impossible for me to have any true allies. All living things, great or small, are the same muck and filth to me, after all.”</p>

      <p>“But you still follow something weaker than you?”</p>

      <p>“That’s not the case. That which I follow is an existence worthy of my devotion.”</p>

      <p>That— From that word, it was either the Evil God, or perhaps the Demon Lord. In any case, it was unrelated to the matter at hand. As Suimei finished asking everything he wanted to ask, all that was left was to head towards the decisive battle, and he kneaded his mana. He already didn’t care at all about concealing it before Reiji.</p>

      <p>In the worst case, it was possible that they would be completely annihilated right where they were. As Suimei began gathering mana that surpassed the force with which Felmenia was doing so earlier, Felmenia yelled out to him.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono!”</p>

      <p>“Stay back! This guy isn’t some half-assed demon! He’s one of those immortal liches I told you about earlier!”</p>

      <p>Hearing those words, Felmenia was able to figure it out. Last time they had a lesson, when they were talking about the ether body, he told her about those who released themselves from death. As she swallowed her saliva hard, he could see the tension in her face. As the air further filled with the thirst for blood, even Ilzarl had a surprised face. As for Lishbaum, who had all that mana pointed towards him, he was stroking his jaw.</p>

      <p>“You don’t have any allies you can depend on today, you know? Alzbayne’s doll princess, Gerard the Melkia, and Beatorex aren’t here, right?”</p>

      <p>“Even so, I won’t step down.”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. That’s what makes you Starfall. An opponent like you who’s bad at giving up is most suitable to me.”</p>

      <p>Saying that, Lishbaum took on an attitude like he was accepting the challenge, but in the next instant, his attitude suddenly changed.</p>

      <p>“Well, I didn’t come here to fight today, though.”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>As if waiting for Suimei’s question, Lishbaum made a broad grin that spread to the corners of his face. And as he turned around, forming ranks in front of his gaze was the wall of imperial soldiers. It was foolish to even ask what he was about to do. He was the Greed of Ten. He had no compassion towards humans. He had no compassion towards any living being.</p>

      <p>“You can’t be— STOOOOOOOOOOOP!”</p>

      <p>“Phase Severance.”</p>

      <p>Immediately following that keyword, the air was divided in two. A boundary line appeared in the air and slipped the two pieces apart. It was just as if everything in the air was drawn over with a pen in a single line and separated top from bottom. And the portion covered by that line was the majority of the imperial encampment. It was none other than the imperial soldiers. And they fell. Heads. Heads. Heads. In an instant, heads all over went tumbling to the ground. It was just like a really bad joke. The slipping piece of air was right at the level of a human’s neck, and everything above it, the tents, the hills behind it, everything was split in two and slipped to the side.</p>

      <p>“Ri... Ridiculous.”</p>

      <p>“No way...”</p>

      <p>The only ones to escape from harm were those near Suimei, his companions, Reiji’s party, Eanru and Jillbert, Reanat, and the Elite Twelve. Seeing that excessively bizarre scenery and the dreadful power which manifested it, Graziella and Reiji muttered, completely dumbfounded. And during that, the one to yell and raise his voice, as one would expect, was Suimei.</p>

      <p>“KUDRACK, YOU FUCKEEEEER!”</p>

      <p>“What are you getting so angry for, Starfall? I saved them, you know? I saved those caught in the fetters of suffering that is this earthly life, and this many of them! So many of them! Death is salvation! It’s the salvation beyond all other means!”</p>

      <p>“Doing that kinda crap! Do you intend on acting like a fucking god?!”</p>

      <p>“A god? That’s wrong. I’m not that kind of being. From beginning to end, I am a human who bears the sins of the world. I will take up the sins of all living beings! Yes! The one who bears all sin! Haha, Hahaha, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>

      <p>Lishbaum let out a truly insane laugh.</p>

      <p>“That which saves all living things! I’ll show that I can remove all the muck! Throughout the entire world! Without leaving a scrap!”</p>

      <p>As Lishbaum finished loudly yelling into the air, he made a complete change, as if a switch was flipped.</p>

      <p>“Now then, it’s over. Let’s withdraw. Aah, I forgot something.”</p>

      <p>“Lish...baum.”</p>

      <p>“Grallajearus, your role has come to an end. Go back to His side.”</p>

      <p>“BASTAAAAAAAAAAARD!”</p>

      <p>“What are you so angry for? It’s the Evil God’s side, you know? You have finished your duty and are now returning to where you came from. I don’t think there’s anything greater than that for you.”</p>

      <p>“Do you think Nakshatra-sama would permit such a—”</p>

      <p>“The lord told me to do as I like. The weak have no qualifications to live in this world. As a demon, you understand that, do you not?”</p>

      <p>Hearing that, Grallajearus could no longer talk. A demon who should have no fear of death was feeling irrepressible feelings of despair at being abandoned by the Demon Lord.</p>

      <p>“Heh, heh... FUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>

      <p>His loud laughter once more rang out. And at the same time, his magicka was activated, and Grallajearus was crushed by the two phases pushing together, annihilated. Thus, all demons aside from Lishbaum and Ilzarl vanished from the imperial encampment.</p>

      <p>“Now then, I will yield this as a victory to the hero and the Empire. Well, this is more of a draw due to injury, though.”</p>

      <p>Though to him, it wasn’t an injury at all. They were going to recreate all the demons. If it was their plan from the beginning to have them all vanish, it didn’t matter how many of them died.</p>

      <p>“Kudrack...”</p>

      <p>“Yakagi Suimei. I will settle the score with you one day. However, this is not the stage for that. At any rate, I shall prepare a suitable battlefield for our fight. Until then, run at full speed as you chase the mysteries, and polish that dream that you all desire so much.”</p>

      <p>And then, Lishbaum hummed those words...</p>

      <p><em>Those who call forth tears, remember. In this world, there is no rain of sorrow that cannot be cleared away. Those who carry anguish, remember. In this world, there is no blaze of pain that cannot be extinguished. We magicians of the Society, in the name of the Magicka King Nestahaim, for the sake of granting the wish that anybody desires...</em></p>

      <p>“Yes. No matter where I am, I will show you that I can erase everything altogether. I will free all living beings from the vortex of pain that is living, and save them all—”</p>

      <p>Leaving behind those intoxicated and distorted words, the Greed of Ten, the lich Kudrack the Ghosthide vanished together with Ilzarl into a liminal world between phases.</p>
