      <h1>Chapter 1: At the Yakagi Residence</h1>

      <p>“So that’s what you guys have been through?” Reiji muttered in a serious tone after Suimei shared the details of their adventure in the Alliance.</p>

      <p>“Yeah,” Suimei replied with a typical shrug. “What can I say? It was pretty rough.”</p>

      <p>“But to think even your childhood friend got summoned...”</p>

      <p>“Heck of a coincidence, huh? When I found out she also had amnesia as a bonus, I really panicked...”</p>

      <p>Talking about it, Suimei reminisced a little over what had happened upon arriving in the Alliance. After catching a glimpse of Hatsumi by chance at the parade, he’d gone to see her. She claimed not to know him, however, and nearly cut him down on the spot. All in all, it was quite an ordeal.</p>

      <p>“But thank goodness,” Reiji said with a relieved smile. “Surely it would have worried you more if she hadn’t regained her memories.”</p>

      <p>“You can say that again.”</p>

      <p>In the end, Hatsumi’s amnesia was resolved. It was a fortunate turn of events that Reiji celebrated as Suimei’s friend. But it seemed something else was going on. Reiji was giving everyone a bright smile, but there was unease in his eyes.</p>

      <p>“It really is great it all worked out. Really...”</p>

      <p>The cause of the gloomy tone in Reiji’s voice was the girl sitting next to him. Even Suimei, who didn’t have a remarkable talent for reading others, took note of the shadow that had fallen over his friend. And he had a fairly good idea as to what it meant.</p>

      <p>In short, Reiji was envious that Suimei and his party had all returned safely. But Reiji wasn’t exactly the type to feel or express jealousy; it more manifested as exhaustion. And it wasn’t hard to imagine why he was so haggard after returning to the Empire with Io Kuzami in tow.</p>

      <p>Sensing all this, Suimei sighed heavily. Reiji was a good friend and, as such, Suimei couldn’t just ignore his problems. But alas, there was more than just that on the table currently.</p>

      <p>“So, did you leave Hero Hatsumi behind in the Alliance?” asked Titania.</p>

      <p>Suimei nodded, but Felmenia took up the story from there.</p>

      <p>“Hatsumi-dono has her own battle she wishes to fight. Suimei-dono respected this, and decided to part ways with her for the time being.”</p>

      <p>“Suimei, are you alright with that?”</p>

      <p>“I have to be. If she’s got her own business to take care of, I wouldn’t be helping anything by dragging her along with me.”</p>

      <p>“But she may cross paths with something dangerous in the Alliance, no?”</p>

      <p>Reiji reacted upon hearing Titania say, “something dangerous.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. You mentioned those Universal Apostles or whatever, right?”</p>

      <p>The Universal Apostles were the mysterious group formed by Eanru, Clarissa, Jillbert, and the mirage man they’d met during the riot in the capital of Miazen. They were the ones manipulating the Anti-Goddess Cult behind the curtain, and they were currently scheming to kidnap Hatsumi. Indeed, Suimei was keenly aware of them.</p>

      <p>Every one of them was a formidable enemy that could singlehandedly drive the members of Suimei’s party into a corner. They were strong—almost absurdly so—and couldn’t be dealt with by ordinary means. As things stood, they were arguably more of a menace than the demon threat.</p>

      <p>But despite their presence, Suimei had left Hatsumi in the Alliance. He couldn’t say he’d done so without hesitation or concern, but he’d done what he thought he had to.</p>

      <p>“Honestly, those guys would still be a problem even if she’d come with me, right? We don’t have any way of knowing when or where they’ll attack. No matter what we do or how we approach this, we’ll never have the initiative. So the best we can do in the meantime is have Hatsumi take care of her business as quickly as possible while I find a way to return. That’s the size of it. Anyways, more importantly...”</p>

      <p>When Suimei foreshadowed a change of subject, Reiji already seemed to know what he was implying. He folded his arms and began groaning.</p>

      <p>“You’re saying we might also be targeted, aren’t you?”</p>

      <p>“After what they said about heroes, yeah.”</p>

      <p>“A scheme that involves the heroes, huh? What a mysterious group...”</p>

      <p>Suimei himself wasn’t sure what they meant to do by kidnapping the heroes, and without that information, there wasn’t much he could say to comfort his friend. Pondering it all, he turned to Lefille. Among the Universal Apostles was Jillbert, who she’d gotten close with in the Empire. She perhaps had the most complex feelings about their new enemies after being forced to fight a friend. As the room filled with a heavy silence, Reiji changed the subject.</p>

      <p>“So, we’re up next, right?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>

      <p>“Indeed.”</p>

      <p>As Reiji spoke, both Titania and Io Kuzami nodded. Suimei had heard about why they’d gone to the self-governed state in the first place, but he’d only gotten a rough outline of what had happened there. That included retrieving the relic and being attacked by a demon general—both of which were things that greatly interested Suimei’s group.</p>

      <p>“Well, candidly speaking... After we parted ways with you guys, we went to see if we could get the hero’s relic in the self-governed state to compensate for our lack of power.”</p>

      <p>Reiji opened with a concise explanation, and each member of Suimei’s group nodded to urge him to continue.</p>

      <p>“Upon arriving, we learned a bit about the relic from the person in charge of the temple and were eventually taken to a deep, sealed chamber where it was kept. It was there that someone claiming to be a demon general attacked us. We fought him off— No, he let us off. After that, we made our way back here to the Empire.”</p>

      <p>It was the same outline he’d given when they reunited outside. Hearing the story once more, Felmenia muttered in a puzzled tone...</p>

      <p>“Attacked by a demon general...?”</p>

      <p>Suimei also found it unexpected that a demon general would directly confront Reiji. Especially considering the circumstances. Nobody should have known that he and his party were in the self-governed state on such a mission.</p>

      <p>“Does this mean that the demons have predicted Reiji-kun’s actions?” Lefille asked.</p>

      <p>Titania shook her head.</p>

      <p>“No, that did not seem to be the case.”</p>

      <p>“Meaning?”</p>

      <p>“The demon general did not know that a hero would be present where the relic was enshrined. He only identified Reiji-sama as a hero after hearing his name.”</p>

      <p>“He called himself Ilzarl, but it seemed like that man’s real goal was the hero’s relic.”</p>

      <p>“I see. So their plan was to confiscate a potential threat.”</p>

      <p>It was likely exactly as Lefille suspected. There was plenty of reason to believe a modern hero would eventually seek out the legendary weapon. And since three of the demon generals had already been cut down, the rest were likely anxious to do away with any possible advantage the heroes might gain over them. Pondering all this, Suimei suddenly looked up at Reiji.</p>

      <p>“Say... You just referred to the demon general as ‘that man,’ didn’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. What about it?”</p>

      <p>“That sort of makes it sound like he was human, so I was just a little curious why you phrased it that way. Did he look like one to you?”</p>

      <p>“Huh, I guess you’re right... But yeah, he did.”</p>

      <p>After hearing what Suimei said, Reiji seemed to realize what he was talking about and nodded. Up until now, the demons and demon generals that Suimei had come across were all beings that were quite distinctly inhuman in one way or another—so much so that gender was an afterthought when looking at one. Naturally there was probably a difference between the sexes, but it wasn’t visually obvious in the way it was with humans. Yet Reiji had distinctly described this one as a man. In other words, this demon at least had the outward appearance of a human male.</p>

      <p>“When he first showed up, we didn’t even think he was a demon. He just looked like a human. A weird one, but a human nonetheless... So yeah, thinking back on it, I guess that is pretty remarkable.”</p>

      <p>“So when you said you were ‘let off,’ Reiji-dono, did that have some kind of connection to his peculiarity?”</p>

      <p>“Mm. That guy was amazingly tough. Even when we all fought together, we could barely scratch him.”</p>

      <p>“That...”</p>

      <p>“So it was hard even with Reiji’s divine blessing, huh?”</p>

      <p>Hearing what Reiji said, Suimei put his hand to his chin and groaned. It was true that Reiji was a complete amateur before coming to this world, but Suimei didn’t think he was weak by any means. He’d fought with demons, defeated Rajas, and competed against Elliot. For there to be an opponent he “could barely scratch” was something of a cause for alarm. Io Kuzami, however, had a different take on the matter and snorted in resentment.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. At that level, if I were to make a serious effort...”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, in the end it was Mizu— Io Kuzami-san’s magic that looked like it was really doing something.”</p>

      <p>“Is that so?”</p>

      <p>As Suimei inquired further, Io Kuzami abruptly grabbed her left hand as if to restrain it.</p>

      <p>“That is so. Well, that demi-ogre caused my left arm to throb, so I should offer him my praise, but—”</p>

      <p>Watching Io Kuzami’s chuuni-like actions, Reiji made a strange face.</p>

      <p>“Um, Io Kuzami-san? At the time, wasn’t it your left eye that was throbbing?” he asked.</p>

      <p>“Hmm? Is that how it was? Then in that case, to cause my left eye to throb—”</p>

      <p>“If you forgot, it isn’t a free-for-all excuse to bring up your stupid evil eye!” Suimei shouted.</p>

      <p>She went from grabbing her left arm to clutching at her left eye. No longer able to take it, Suimei couldn’t help retorting. He just couldn’t understand why she had to exaggerate every little thing before she was satisfied.</p>

      <p>“The point is that the demon general was strong,” Reiji clarified.</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? Do you mean to imply he could have bested me? That I’m weaker than he?”</p>

      <p>“Listen, that’s...”</p>

      <p>As Io Kuzami renewed a pointless argument with Reiji, Lefille took it upon herself to get things back on track.</p>

      <p>“We’re getting nowhere like this, Reiji-kun. You said he was strong, but what does that mean? Can you give us some kind of perspective?”</p>

      <p>“Um, let’s see...”</p>

      <p>“Haven’t I been telling you? He was but a small fry roughly on the level of a dragonnewt—hardly a worthy opponent for my greatness.”</p>

      <p>“...”</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami took each and every opportunity to worm her way back into the conversation, and even Lefille was starting to get annoyed. Sensing that this was indeed a fruitless exercise, Suimei turned to Titania for an intervention. She partially closed her eyes as if remembering what happened, then began speaking.</p>

      <p>“That demon general’s power is a considerable threat. He easily brushed aside our magic and manipulated a powerful red lightning that was not in itself magic. His physical abilities were also astounding. How should I put it...? Not even my speed was able to do much against him.”</p>

      <p>“I see...”</p>

      <p>Because Suimei had fought Titania before, he was quite familiar with her strength. And if she said the demon general in question was strong, Suimei knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was an opponent not to be underestimated.</p>

      <p>“Was there anything else that stuck out about him?”</p>

      <p>As Reiji and Titania pondered over Suimei’s question, Io Kuzami smiled.</p>

      <p>“Why the silence? There is but one more matter worth mentioning. He called all of us offerings, did he not?”</p>

      <p>“Ah!”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, now that you mention it...”</p>

      <p>Hearing what Io Kuzami said, the lightbulb seemed to come on for the other two. Suimei made a grim expression.</p>

      <p>“Offerings?”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. That demi-ogre did not hesitate to treat humans as mere foodstuff. In fact, several defenders of the temple met such a fate at his hands.”</p>

      <p>“Wait, wait, wait. You’re saying it wasn’t just a bluff? That he seriously eats people...?”</p>

      <p>Suimei seemed to be at a loss, but Reiji and Titania both nodded to confirm just what he didn’t want to hear. People who held absolute confidence in their abilities usually tended to exaggerate their power before their inferiors. And that’s what Suimei had assumed was going on when Io Kuzami first said this demon general referred to humans as “offerings.” But to think that he was really a man-eating monster...</p>

      <p>When Suimei looked into Reiji and Titania’s faces, he could see the horror in their eyes. They’d seen the evidence of the unholy feast—that much was clear. Seeming to realize something, Felmenia questioned them with a grim expression.</p>

      <p>“It couldn’t be... Is the reason Gregory-dono and the others are not here because...”</p>

      <p>The same thought had crossed Suimei’s mind. It was unusual for the knights who were always with Titania not to be by her side. As Suimei and the others grew tense waiting for the answer, Titania shook her head.</p>

      <p>“White Flame-dono, there is no need to worry. Gregory and the others were injured and remained in the self-governed state, but they will all be fine.”</p>

      <p>“Thank goodness...”</p>

      <p>“Well, at least there’s some good news.”</p>

      <p>Felmenia let out a sigh of relief and Suimei nodded in approval. In Felmenia’s case, she was concerned about the safety of her countrymen. Suimei had only met Gregory and the others in passing, but they took care of Reiji and Mizuki. If something happened to them, it wouldn’t sit well with him. But after such worries were dispelled, Lefille let out something of a baffled groan.</p>

      <p>“I understand that whoever attacked all of you was a monster that ate people, but that behavior isn’t typical of demons...”</p>

      <p>“Yes, I also find that part mysterious. I have never even heard of it.”</p>

      <p>Felmenia seconded Lefille’s point—and it was a good one. Even though the demons were unequivocally evil, inhuman beings, Suimei had also never heard of them eating people before.</p>

      <p>“I do not understand it myself, but the opponent we fought was indeed a man-eating monster.”</p>

      <p>In the end, Titania was unable to enlighten them any. They just didn’t have access to the right information. All they knew was that a menacing demon general had appeared. As the grim conversation was about to come to an end, the one who brought up the man-eating aspect in the first place—Io Kuzami—spoke up.</p>

      <p>“My eternal rival, do you not have any ideas?”</p>

      <p>“Why’re you asking me? Don’t just throw this at me.”</p>

      <p>“Well? I just thought I’d entertain any of your delusions that might fit the bill.”</p>

      <p>Suimei couldn’t tell what Io Kuzami was thinking as she peered at him with an extremely interested gaze. But while he was trying to figure it out, Reiji leaned forward and echoed the sentiment.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, I’d also like to hear what you think.”</p>

      <p>“Hey, you too now...?”</p>

      <p>Seeing that Reiji was jumping on the bandwagon, Suimei grumbled. Just why did they have such absolute faith in Suimei’s opinion in situations like this? In truth, there was a lot of insight he had to offer as a magician, but if he said too much here, his identity would be exposed. That fear suppressed him to silence.</p>

      <p>But upon seeing that all eyes in the room were fixed on him, he realized that he had nowhere to run. As Suimei drew in a deep breath and resigned himself, he looked right at Io Kuzami. It wasn’t a glare, but the sharp gaze of a magician.</p>

      <p>“What is it?”</p>

      <p>“...Earlier you called that demon general a demi-ogre, right? What did you mean by that?”</p>

      <p>“Exactly as it sounds. If I were to say it in the language of you lot, that being was a demi-ogre.”</p>

      <p>Not quite grasping who she was alluding to by “you lot,” Suimei questioned Felmenia without shifting his gaze.</p>

      <p>“Menia, what’s a demi-ogre?”</p>

      <p>“I... I also do not really know.”</p>

      <p>Felmenia didn’t know, so Suimei then asked Lefille. She just closed her eyes and shook her head. Glancing to Titania and Reiji next, they also looked puzzled. That could only mean one thing—that demi-ogres weren’t really a thing of this world. And if that were the case, Suimei might have a clue or two as to what was going on.</p>

      <p>“Everything I say from here on is pure conjecture on my part. I think that demon general is probably at the top of the food chain of this world.”</p>

      <p>“The top of the food chain?”</p>

      <p>Suimei nodded in response to Reiji’s question, but naturally, the three girls from this world didn’t understand this talk of food chains.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, what do you mean?”</p>

      <p>“I meant exactly what I said. In the world we come from, mankind stands at the top of the food chain. But here, I think a more powerful being occupies that spot.”</p>

      <p>In Suimei’s world—as far as normal people like Reiji knew—it was common knowledge that humans were the ultimate apex predator. It was ultimately up to them to decide what other creatures lived and died. Of course, this was ignoring the fact that even they were common prey for the strongest biological being on the planet—bacteria. But Suimei knew bringing that up would only needlessly complicate things, so he readily left it out.</p>

      <p>And as far as society was concerned, the creatures they didn’t know about and didn’t cross swords with were nonexistent. There was no need to bring those up in front of Reiji and Mizuki, either. Normal humans were better off not knowing that there were monsters lurking in the darkness waiting to knock humanity down a peg. Nevertheless...</p>

      <p>Even after Suimei brought up the food chain, Reiji still didn’t quite catch his meaning.</p>

      <p>“Even if you tell me that humans eat other animals...”</p>

      <p>“That’s not explicitly the point. Try thinking of the beings on top as those who aren’t threatened at all by the existence of other animals. In this world, there are therianthropes, dwarves, elves, dragonnewts, and all manner of other species. It’s less a question of if there’s something that eats humans and more a question of if humanity has any natural enemies other than demons.”</p>

      <p>In other words, was there something that preyed upon humans? In Suimei’s world, the answer would be something akin to ogres and vampires. But in this world... Titania in particular looked like she was deeply pondering the answer.</p>

      <p>“Certainly, that may be the case... The demon general we faced did say something about lending Demon Lord Nakshatra his power. In other words, that he was not a demon.”</p>

      <p>“So that’s to say he’s not a subordinate or servant. In that case, he’s probably something like a third party that endorses the Evil God’s plans... Though when I say it out loud, it sounds pretty strange.”</p>

      <p>That was the part that left Suimei uneasy. He had already deduced that the conflict between the demons and the other beings of this world was a war by proxy between the Goddess and the Evil God.</p>

      <p>To make an analogy with the human body, the demons would be something like a virus invading from outside. In response, the body would rally antibodies to defend itself from within. But what if a portion of those antibodies revolted and started working with the virus? If that was what was going on, they were going about everything the wrong way. As Suimei groaned at that grim possibility, Io Kuzami raised a rather interested voice.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. That is quite an amusing idea.”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, thanks.”</p>

      <p>After glossing over her words with a noncommittal thanks, Suimei glanced at Reiji, who was nodding his head repeatedly in admiration.</p>

      <p>“Uh, Reiji?”</p>

      <p>“Ah, yeah. I was just thinking it’s probably as you said. Despite calling it conjecture, I think you’ve pretty much hit the nail on the head... Though I have to ask. Where did you get that idea?”</p>

      <p>There it was. Suimei had predicted he’d get a question like that, and answered Reiji without a hint of defensiveness.</p>

      <p>“From something I read back in Astel’s royal castle. I kinda put the rest together.”</p>

      <p>“There’s more to it, right?”</p>

      <p>Hearing those words, Suimei could feel his heart skip a beat. Reiji looked at him skeptically.</p>

      <p>“As I thought, Suimei, you’ve got a little bit of <em>that</em> going for you.”</p>

      <p>Reiji looked between Io Kuzami and Suimei several times, leading Suimei to realize what he meant. His secret was safe, but he couldn’t accept Reiji thinking <em>that</em> way about him. Standing up from his chair, he raised his voice in protest.</p>

      <p>“Hey, stop that! Don’t lump me together with her!”</p>

      <p>“But you know...”</p>

      <p>Even as Suimei yelled, Reiji made a somewhat sour face as he talked. He looked exhausted, but there was no mistaking that Suimei was being teased. And then, for better or worse, Io Kuzami joined in.</p>

      <p>“Fuahaha... Oh, my eternal rival, this simply means that you cannot rebel against the damned blood flowing through thy body. It is about time you resign your bastard self and accept thy place at my side.”</p>

      <p>“No way! I’m not gonna call myself ‘Dark Crimson Hider,’ you hear me?! I’d rather die!”</p>

      <p>“My goodness, to think that you would still be so shy. Hmph, you have a long way to go yet.”</p>

      <p>“What the hell are you talking about?! Hey, Reiji, do something! This is all because of what you said!”</p>

      <p>“Lalala, I can’t hear yooouuuuu!”</p>

      <p>Reiji turned around and put his fingers in his ears, blatantly ignoring the yelling Suimei. As their friendly (?) little exchange continued, Lefille looked up at Suimei and whispered to him privately.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-kun, this demon general... Do you think he’s as strong as they say?”</p>

      <p>“In all likelihood, yes. Man-eaters are just what you’d think—natural enemies of man. Moreover...”</p>

      <p>“Moreover?”</p>

      <p>“Back when I talked about Eanru, Hatsumi’s half-elf companion and Rumeya-san mentioned something about a ‘Man-Eating Evil,’ remember?”</p>

      <p>“Now that you mention it, yes. It was supposedly terrifyingly strong or something... Hmm?”</p>

      <p>In the middle of remembering what they’d talked about at the fortress, Lefille inclined her head to the side in a charming way.</p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

      <p>“I seem to recall a dragonnewt being the one to defeat the Man-Eating Evil. It’s just a possibility, but...”</p>

      <p>Hearing those words, the color ran from Suimei’s face. It was his natural response to hearing about anything that involved the dragonnewt Eanru. If what he had defeated was the demon general Reiji and the others were talking about, or one of his kin, then just how powerful was he really?</p>

      <p>“Ugh, my head hurts... What the hell? That dragon asshole is <em>that</em> strong? I don’t want to ever fight him again.”</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? Didn’t you promise him a rematch?”</p>

      <p>“I didn’t promise anything. That was all on him, so as far as I’m concerned, no.”</p>

      <p>Suimei was retreating from reality like a spoiled child. But, upon realizing that most everyone had deteriorated into talking among themselves, Titania tried to get things back on track.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, is it about time that we move on to the next topic?”</p>

      <p>“Y-Yeah, let’s do that... What’s next on the docket?”</p>

      <p>“Um, next is...”</p>

      <p>Suimei was more than happy to change the subject, but Titania averted her gaze when he inquired about the new topic like it was something hard for her to talk about. That alone told him what it was. Perhaps it went without saying, since it was the elephant in the room. Like they’d rehearsed it, everyone turned towards Io Kuzami at the same time and let out one collective sigh. Upon witnessing this, Io Kuzami smirked.</p>

      <p>“Hmph, to have you all sigh over me so... This beauty of mine... It is terrifying, if I do say so myself.”</p>

      <p>Hearing Io Kuzami’s completely off-base interpretation, everyone hung their heads. Just how out of touch was she? Putting that aside, Suimei charged into the real topic at hand.</p>

      <p>“So, what gives?”</p>

      <p>“Back when we were fighting Demon General Ilzarl,” Reiji replied. “I don’t know... This just suddenly happened.”</p>

      <p>“Suddenly? With no warning or trigger?”</p>

      <p>“It was in the middle of the fight, so I couldn’t really say.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm...”</p>

      <p>Suimei fell deep into thought with a severe expression on his face. But nothing jumped out at him. He then turned to Io Kuzami, as if to ask for an explanation. He prodded her with his discerning gaze, but all she did was smirk. Chances were that she knew, she just wasn’t saying. Since she’d demanded that Suimei keep their prior exchange a secret, she likely had no intention of talking about it here. Reiji then folded his arms together as he groaned.</p>

      <p>“As I thought... This means it’s a split personality, right?”</p>

      <p>“I gotta wonder.”</p>

      <p>“And that’s completely out of our realm of expertise...”</p>

      <p>Each sigh Reiji let out was heavier than the last. The way to cure Mizuki—to get her back to normal—was completely out of reach. Knowing that only made him more anxious. And because Suimei couldn’t tell him the truth, his only option was to play dumb.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono, it sounds like you and Reiji-dono are familiar with Mizuki-dono’s Io Kuzami-dono, but just what is she?”</p>

      <p>It was a question filled to the brim with proper honorifics. Felmenia seemed to have trouble following what she was saying herself as she asked it, but following up after her, Lefille leaned forward in curiosity on her tip toes.</p>

      <p>“I’m also curious. It seems the two of you know something we don’t.”</p>

      <p>“That’s... something I don’t really want to talk about. I’d be digging in Mizuki’s wounds and heaping the salt on.”</p>

      <p>Hearing Suimei’s metaphor, Felmenia grimaced.</p>

      <p>“That is quite an extreme way of putting it, isn’t it...?”</p>

      <p>“The whole thing is extreme. The image of Mizuki burying her face in her pillow and kicking around violently comes to mind.”</p>

      <p>Hearing Suimei say that, Reiji closed his eyes and nodded. It seemed he too could visualize the same thing. If Suimei didn’t tell them exactly what Io Kuzami was, the others would never understand. But the explanation wasn’t exactly simple.</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami—the name the thing possessing Mizuki was using—was taken from the persona Mizuki had created in middle school. You see, back then, she was dealing with a very severe case of the illness known as chuunibyou, which was quite common in kids that age. At every given opportunity, she would say meaningful things in meaningless ways, use antiquated speech, dress in a flashy fashion, and all manner of other things. In general, she spoke and behaved oddly.</p>

      <p>And part of that was developing the persona she referred to as Io Kuzami. As her friends, it was something that had left Reiji and Suimei stumped. It seemed that the thing that had possessed her currently—in order to avoid Reiji and the others detecting the possession—had faithfully reproduced said persona.</p>

      <p>Right now, Suimei was unable to discern why this spirit had possessed Mizuki. He groaned as he recalled the last time he’d had to deal with Io Kuzami. The present Io Kuzami, however, was demanding gratitude.</p>

      <p>“You have been saying whatever you please for some time now, but I have not heard a single word of thanks for my great efforts in saving you all.”</p>

      <p>“That’s... certainly true... but...”</p>

      <p>Reiji grimaced. Thanking her earnestly wouldn’t be easy.</p>

      <p>“Did that really happen?” Suimei asked.</p>

      <p>“Mm. Io Kuzami-san mentioned earlier how that demon general wasn’t anything special to her, right? The moment after Mizuki turned into Io Kuzami-san, she used a spell of mixed attributes against the demon general.”</p>

      <p>After Reiji’s explanation, Titania followed up in apparent astonishment.</p>

      <p>“It was quite the surprise. To think such spells even exist...”</p>

      <p>“Indeed. That magic of mine was quite powerful, was it not?”</p>

      <p>“Sure was...”</p>

      <p>Hearing Reiji give his frank impression, Io Kuzami looked completely satisfied. Outwardly, she looked high on admiration and praise, but Suimei knew whatever was going on inside had to be more complicated than that. While he was attempting to scrutinize the inner workings of her head, Reiji turned to Felmenia curiously.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-dono, is something the matter?” she asked.</p>

      <p>“No, I was just thinking that you didn’t seem very surprised, Sensei.”</p>

      <p>“Oh?”</p>

      <p>“I mean, come on... You heard me say she used a mixed attribute spell, right?”</p>

      <p>Reiji continued to look at her with a curious expression, which Felmenia reciprocated. Basically, Reiji was wondering why she’d had no reaction to hearing about the extraordinary magic Io Kuzami used. In this world, the mixing of attributes would be tantamount to a huge technological breakthrough. But to Felmenia, who had been receiving lessons from Suimei, this was essentially old news. Upon realizing the disconnect, however, Felmenia cleared her throat and began replying.</p>

      <p>“Ahem... The magic that you and Her Royal Highness witnessed is certainly rare, but if you think about it carefully, then it is not all that large of a leap.”</p>

      <p>“Meaning?”</p>

      <p>“Just now, you said that it was a mixture of attributes, but would it not be more appropriate to say that it was a spell that borrowed properties from both attributes?”</p>

      <p>Hearing Felmenia’s reply, Reiji cocked his head to the side. To him, it sounded like she’d just said the same thing twice. And indeed they were similar, but there was a critical difference.</p>

      <p>“The mixing of attributes... In short, you could say that it is the creation of a new concept. For example, if you mix the fire and earth attributes, what is the attribute that would be brought about in the end? That is, of course, knowledge that we have no way of acquiring. But if what you said about her spell is true, it would mean that Io Kuzami-dono gave birth to a completely new attribute... Would you mind relaying to me the chant that Io Kuzami-dono used?”</p>

      <p>“Um, if I remember right, it went: ‘Oh Fire and Earth...’ Oh, I see...”</p>

      <p>“As I thought, they are separate, right?”</p>

      <p>Felmenia nodded as Reiji came to an understanding.</p>

      <p>“Right from the outset of the chant, it declares the use of two attributes. In accordance with that, the spell will consult the power of two different Elements, so it is not a separate magic system that mixes them together. Looking at it from the Elements’ point of view, there is no way to demonstrate the existence of an Element other than the eight attributes. So while I cannot declare that such a thing is impossible, it is extremely improbable.”</p>

      <p>Felmenia paused there for a moment before continuing her explanation.</p>

      <p>“Magic can be summed up as the relationship between the Elements. In other words, it can be thought of as rival Elements opposing each other. However, there are also Elements that have a natural affinity and cooperative nature. That’s important when using magic in this world. One must remember the basis of the relationship of the Elements being used.”</p>

      <p>When it came to using magicka, it could be said that there was no such thing as actually mixing two different completed magickas together. It was possible to take flames born of magicka and wind born of magicka—in other words, the phenomenon brought about by spells—and mix them together, but otherwise, such forces were dispositionally opposed to one another.</p>

      <p>Magic in this world, however, was reliant on calling upon the power of the Elements. That made it possible to mix spells of the same attribute. It was hypothetically possible to do the same with different attributes, but there was a key problem with that. Without knowing which Element (in this case, the new Element created by the merger of two existing ones) to meditate on, any such mixed spell would never come to life.</p>

      <p>As such, rather than saying two attributes were being mixed, it was more proper to say that a spell borrowed power from two attributes. Hearing her explain it so, Reiji looked convinced.</p>

      <p>“Well, when you put it like that, I guess so, huh? That’s Sensei for you.”</p>

      <p>Perhaps realizing the admiration welling within him, Reiji spoke rather humbly. However, Felmenia shook her head at this.</p>

      <p>“All I did was point out a minor flaw in your way of thinking. However...”</p>

      <p>“It sounds incredibly useful, and... like we should be able to use it too.”</p>

      <p>It was there Reiji came to understand what Felmenia was trying to convey. He’d been hung up on a turn of phrase, but she’d unraveled the real meaning behind it in an easy to understand way. It was just a matter of changing your approach—the way you were thinking. That was one of the most essential components of Western occultism. By changing your point of view, it was possible to see things that were not visible before. This applied to any field, but for Western occultism that was primarily concerned with the physical and metaphysical, to thoroughly investigate the true nature of things and draw ever nearer to the truth was an indispensable part of the practice.</p>

      <p>“So, Sensei, can you use it?” Reiji asked.</p>

      <p>“No, I’m... Certainly, if I wanted to try it, then it would not be impossible, but...”</p>

      <p>Right now, Felmenia was likely capable of performing the magic they were talking about. Really, as she was now, she could probably do so with ease. But even then, using magicka was far more powerful and efficient since it wasn’t bound to attributes and Elements in the first place.</p>

      <p>But she wanted to avoid explaining that she was able to use much stronger spells than that, leaving her at a bit of a loss as to how to respond to Reiji. She was mumbling and stalling with a sullen expression, but Io Kuzami seemed to pick up on her internal debate.</p>

      <p>“That magic of mine is powerful, you know? If you are so inclined, would you like to try and see?”</p>

      <p>“No, it’s not that I doubt the power of the spell...”</p>

      <p>Despite the small bit of provocation, Felmenia showed no signs of taking the bait. She was still at a loss. Suimei replied for her.</p>

      <p>“Quit it. For now.”</p>

      <p>“What? How boring.”</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami gave a dissatisfied reply to Suimei’s aggravated words, but quietly backed down for the moment. If her self-confidence was to be believed, her magic was indeed quite powerful. If the thing that had possessed Mizuki was a spirit connected to this world like Suimei suspected, its connection to the Elements would be on a level that surpassed any human. That alone would strengthen its magic significantly. So even if Felmenia used the same type of spell, it wouldn’t compare to Io Kuzami’s.</p>

      <p>As Io Kuzami was still pouting, Liliana entered the living room. After peeping from the door, she wandered over towards Suimei and the others. Watching her adorable behavior, the women in the room were all smiling broadly. But rather than take a seat with everyone, for some reason Liliana headed towards Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“Have you finished frolicking with the cats? Hmm?”</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami sounded like she was being playful with a child, but Liliana did not respond to her. She simply turned to Suimei with a sour look on her face.</p>

      <p>“Is Mizuki... still ridiculous?”</p>

      <p>“As you can see for yourself.”</p>

      <p>“Calling me ridiculous is quite impertinent of you. I am perfectly normal, you know?”</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami frowned at being so ignored, while Liliana continued making a sour face.</p>

      <p>“I should think not. I feel like... something bad... has possessed you.”</p>

      <p>“Uncooperative” would be more accurate than “bad,” but that was a minor contention. Unlike Reiji and Titania, Liliana could sense something about Io Kizami. The girl touched by the malicious power of darkness likely sensed something threatening. That’s what Suimei suspected.</p>

      <p>Io Kuzami grimaced as Liliana leaned in and scrutinized her face. And then...</p>

      <p>“Now... Take this.”</p>

      <p>“Bwuh?!”</p>

      <p>As if she was looking forward to it, Liliana pulled on both of Io Kuzami’s cheeks. Seeing this, everyone went wide-eyed. Suimei had no idea what she was up to. No, with Io Kuzami’s cheeks in her hands, it was quite obvious what she was up to. Liliana was pushing and pulling on Io Kuzami’s face like it was clay in her hands.</p>

      <p>“Ugh! Wh...at in all the h...ells are you do...ing?!”</p>

      <p>“Bring back Mizuki. No, leave Mizuki... and never come back.”</p>

      <p>“Hey! Lily!”</p>

      <p>Liliana squished and reshaped Io Kuzami’s face as she tried to physically drive her out. Unable to let this continue, Lefille cut between them in a fluster. Back when Liliana was depressed, Mizuki had done a lot to cheer her up and care for her. That was likely why she was trying to do what she could for her now. She felt like she owed her that much.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Lefille managed to pry Liliana away from Io Kuzami. But that didn’t seem to deter her. She thrust a finger out at Io Kuzami with a snap. It looked like she was planning on using her Astral Shooter to give her a good shock. Seeing this, Suimei stepped in.</p>

      <p>“Liliana, stop that.”</p>

      <p>“Why? If something... has possessed Mizuki... won’t this drive it out?”</p>

      <p>“No, it’s probably useless. Give it up.”</p>

      <p>“Fine... I understand.”</p>

      <p>Hearing his words, Liliana lowered her arm despondently. Meanwhile, Reiji and Titania simply looked like they had no idea what was going on.</p>

      <p>Astral Shooter was the technique Suimei had taught Liliana to extend her own astral body to attack an opponent’s. It manifested a physical effect by making use of the connection between the physical and astral body. The astral body referred to the shell that enveloped a being spiritually. To put it roughly, it was the glue that bound together the things known as the soul and the consciousness. And since consciousness was part of the astral body, astral attacks weren’t as effective against targets who’d fainted or were asleep.</p>

      <p>And presently, Mizuki wasn’t conscious either, meaning she was in a state in which an astral attack wouldn’t reach her. But the astral body of the thing possessing Mizuki <em>was</em> connected to her body right now, so it should still affect Io Kuzami. Liliana’s aim was likely to use her Astral Shooter to take decisive action against it and, if circumstances permitted, pull it out and urge Mizuki’s mind to reawaken. Little did she know it was effectively impossible to wake someone from an out of body experience. However, because the proprietor of the outer layer of the consciousness was not the soul, the astral body and physical body were not so firmly connected that it would be impossible to remove something that had become attached in the wrong place.</p>

      <p>Such a high-handed method would be befitting of exorcism, which was likely the approach Liliana had taken. But even if she did it and succeeded, it would only purge rather than erase the thing possessing Mizuki. And without anything to defend Mizuki, it could simply just possess her all over again. If Suimei at least knew its real name, he would be able to bind it and obstruct any attempts at repossession, but...</p>

      <p>Despite having just been pinched mercilessly by Liliana, Io Kuzami for some reason had a content look on her face.</p>

      <p>“Oh patched eye girl, you have quite the violent and dangerous side to you, don’t you? Indeed, those garments are also to my liking. I shall make you my disciple.”</p>

      <p>“I decline.”</p>

      <p>“Of course. Now that you have become my disciple, you require your own darkness codename... We shall start with a temporary one. You are the black emissary who hides the evil eye of the dragon king, so ‘Dragon Eyes Black Lolita’ shall do.”</p>

      <p>“Is this a card game now...?”</p>

      <p>“It really is like a card game name...”</p>

      <p>“She’s not... listening to me...”</p>

      <p>As if she hadn’t heard Liliana’s refusal at all, Io Kuzami was steadily moving forward with the preparations (?) to make Liliana her disciple. Those observing her vainglorious behavior were split between exasperation and exhaustion. Granted, that had largely been the reaction to Io Kuzami from the start.</p>

      <p>However, the chaos in the Yakagi residence was far from over. Right after one disturbance quieted down, another came rioting to the forefront.</p>

      <p>“...Hmm?”</p>

      <p>Suimei noticed the abrupt irregularity and frowned dubiously.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono, is something the matter?”</p>

      <p>“We have a guest. On top of that... Hey, they’re just entering the house as they please!”</p>

      <p>The Yakagi residence in the Empire was the same as the Yakagi residence in Japan in that it was protected by a barrier of sensory and monitoring magicka. Because of that, whenever there were intruders or visitors, that information was relayed directly to Suimei’s mind.</p>

      <p>“Who is it, Suimei-dono?”</p>

      <p>“Wai— It’s that dangerous woman!”</p>

      <p>“Wh-What?!”</p>

      <p>Hearing Suimei’s ominous words, Lefille was the one who yelled out loudly. She seemed to have guessed who it was on that description alone. After all, there was only one person Suimei talked about that way. As Lefille began panicking, Liliana observed her with a knitted brow.</p>

      <p>“What’s wrong... Lefille?”</p>

      <p>“This is the worst possible situation! I-Is there somewhere I can hide?!”</p>

      <p>“You need... a hiding place? If so... then they’re all over. Like there... for example.”</p>

      <p>Liliana glanced over to a desk set up in the corner of the living room with a quilt over it. Certainly, considering her current stature, Lefille would be able to hide herself under it. It would be rather cramped and unpleasant, but desperate times called for desperate measures. Resigning herself, the panicking Lefille transformed into a red gale and leaped into hiding. In the blink of an eye, she was stowed under the desk, but her long, red ponytail was still sticking out. It was a somewhat comical case of hiding one’s head, but leaving their ass exposed. Indeed, she was perfectly given away as she was, but nobody could bring themselves to tell her.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, when you said ‘that dangerous woman,’ did you mean Her Imperial Highness Graziella?” asked Titania, her expression betraying her clenched jaw.</p>

      <p>“Yeah. Come to think of it, you hate her too, don’t you? Should I turn her away?”</p>

      <p>“Kick her out! Make her leave!” shouted the desk from the corner.</p>

      <p>Ignoring the unasked-for commotion, Suimei looked at Titania with a troubled expression.</p>

      <p>“No, it’s fine. I am personally rather reluctant, but please do as you see fit.”</p>

      <p>In other words, Titania was alright with letting her in. If she’d come here, after all, it was likely on some sort of business. But even knowing that, Titania couldn’t help the grand sigh that escaped her lips. They still didn’t get along.</p>

      <p>Suimei then looked at Reiji, who also nodded. He had no objection. And before long, the door to the living room opened. The one to appear in the doorway, as everyone expected, was Imperial Princess Graziella Filas Rieseld.</p>

      <p>Without a single escort, she’d come on her own. Perhaps that was because of her unshakable conceit, but even though it was inside the imperial capital, the Yakagi residence should have been hostile territory for her. Nevertheless, she didn’t seem to be on guard in the least. In fact, the first thing that came out of her mouth was something that sounded an awful lot like an apology.</p>

      <p>“Sorry I’m late. The reports had really piled up.”</p>

      <p>Her announcement of tardiness made it sound like it had been her intention to come here all along. And sooner, no less. Everyone beheld her with a puzzled expression, but Graziella was looking over to the corner of the living room. At the ponytail sticking out from the desk, specifically. There was no need to ask the reason for her skeptical look.</p>

      <p>“...By the way, what is that?”</p>

      <p>Hearing Graziella’s question, Lefille’s ponytail jumped in fright. Lefille was unable to see anybody from her hiding spot, so she wasn’t yet certain she’d been found out... though the atmosphere in the room probably gave it away. Perhaps unable to bear the awkward silence any longer, she came out from under the desk.</p>

      <p>“Hmph... So you spotted me.”</p>

      <p>Lefille had more or less accepted her fate, but she was acting like nothing happened and trying to brush her embarrassing failure under the rug. She was trying to act cool, but it just wasn’t working with the way she looked. Meanwhile, when Graziella saw (the now tiny) Lefille, her gaze grew even more scrutinizing.</p>

      <p>“Who is that? She seems familiar.”</p>

      <p>“What? Oh, um... I’m, um...”</p>

      <p>It seemed she hadn’t been found out yet after all. Clinging to that hope, she made one last desperate attempt to deceive Graziella, but she was too slow on the draw. Reiji and Titania were far faster.</p>

      <p>“It’s Lefille-san.”</p>

      <p>“It is the Shrine Maiden of Spirits.”</p>

      <p>“NOOOOOOOO! You can’t tell her!”</p>

      <p>They had no ill intentions; they were simply telling the truth. But it was a death sentence to Lefille. After she shrieked, the room sank into silence.</p>

      <p>“The Shrine Maiden of Spirits? This little girl?”</p>

      <p>When Graziella asked for confirmation, Lefille nodded once. It was quite hard to believe that a person could shrink, but perhaps because Graziella was familiar with Lefille, she couldn’t laugh off the resemblance. Meanwhile, Lefille was suddenly gripped by a strange notion.</p>

      <p>“H-Hmph! Wanna fight? If you do, then I’ll gladly accept your challenge! I can still use the power of the spirits in this form this time! So if you’re going to come at me, then come!”</p>

      <p>Lefille began shadowboxing, throwing her tiny punches in Graziella’s direction. Her movements were impressively swift, but that only increased the strangeness of the situation. Graziella was left utterly befuddled. Eventually, after managing to take it all in, or perhaps just hitting her breaking point...</p>

      <p>“Pfft! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! What the hell is this?! Isn’t it just far too silly?! T-Tiny! You’re tiny, you know?! No matter how you look at it, this is foul play, Shrine Maiden-dono! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>

      <p>Graziella could scarcely contain her laughter. She was in stitches, nearly doubled over and holding her sides as she roared. As for the subject of her laughter, Lefille was mortified and on the verge of tears.</p>

      <p>“Fuuuuuuuuck! Don’t laugh! I’m not like this because I want to be! So not one more laugh out of you! If you insist on continuing, then I won’t show any mercy!”</p>

      <p>With tears in her eyes, Lefille was stomping her feet and flailing her arms. And in a most unusual turn for her, she even started cursing. In response to that, Graziella did her best to speak through her laughter.</p>

      <p>“N-No, I will cease for now. I have a debt to repay you, but it would merely be considered bullying right now. And it’s not nice to bully the weak, now is it, Shrine Maiden-dono?”</p>

      <p>Graziella turned a pointed gaze on Lefille as she spoke plainly of her grudge. It sounded like she was criticizing something that had come up the last time they encountered one another. Lefille seemed to be at a loss for words, and after trembling in frustration for a while...</p>
      
<p>“UWAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>

      <p>She let out a full-throttle wail of frustration and stormed away. As if chasing her from the area, Graziella’s laughter filled the room once more.</p>

      <p>“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I can’t—I just can’t! This is... f-far too silly...”</p>

      <p>Her words contained not a hint of sarcasm. It seemed she found Lefille’s reaction to be honestly amusing. Plunking down into a chair, she continued to cackle. Having passed on interjecting in their exchange, Suimei’s thoughts turned pityingly on Lefille as he groaned.</p>

      <p class="centerp section-marking">★</p>

      <p>When Lefille eventually returned after storming off, Graziella took to questioning her immediately.</p>

      <p>“So, what happened? What’s become of you, Shrine Maiden-dono?”</p>

      <p>She was being perfectly serious, but because she still couldn’t quite contain herself, an unmistakable grin rose on her lips. Lefille stuck her tongue out and pouted in an extremely childlike fashion.</p>

      <p>“Nothing in particular!” she huffed, turning her head away indignantly.</p>

      <p>“But look at you. Unless my eyes deceive me, you’re quite a bit smaller than when we last met.”</p>

      <p>“Do you have some sort of complaint, Your Highness?”</p>

      <p>“Hardly. In fact, I find it rather amusing. Why don’t we schedule appearances for you at the imperial cathedral like this? Demonstrating your skills as the Shrine Maiden of the Spirits in such a sweet form, I’m sure the faithful would come in droves to see you. Though most of them would probably be there to curry your favor. Pfft...!”</p>

      <p>A peep of Graziella’s stifled laughter leaked out. She was likely imagining a tiny Lefille trying to rake in money at the cathedral.</p>

      <p>“Absolutely not! I am not some exhibition!”</p>

      <p>After Lefille refused her proposal, Graziella’s expression suddenly became serious.</p>

      <p>“What are you saying? Gloss over it all you like, but influential figures and celebrities were meant to be put on display. They’re public figures, so why not let the public get a good look at them? There’s nothing more to it than that.”</p>

      <p>“Grrr...”</p>

      <p>Lefille couldn’t argue with her. She didn’t like the implications of treating someone like an exhibition, but Graziella had a rather sound point about the nature of public figures. Their presence was a positive thing. Even if they themselves didn’t enjoy it, that was simply the price of fame.</p>

      <p>“But my, you’re quite cute like this. I’d never have dreamed it, seeing your original form.”</p>

      <p>“Shut up! I’m still cute even in my original form!”</p>

      <p>Even though Graziella was speaking honestly without putting on airs, Lefille still stamped her foot in objection. Meanwhile, everyone beholding this was struck with a single thought: “<em>That’s</em> what she’s objecting to?”</p>

      <p>“Suimei-kun! Don’t you also owe Her Highness a debt?! Repay it and defeat her right here! Reduce her to ashes! No, leave nothing behind!”</p>

      <p>The great Shrine Maiden of Spirits suddenly took the conversation in a rather violent direction. She was urging Suimei to settle his dispute with Graziella in his own living room. As one would expect, he wasn’t exactly about to jump on that bandwagon.</p>

      <p>“No, no way. No matter how you put it, that’s a little...”</p>

      <p>“Are you not my ally?!”</p>

      <p>“Lefi, sometimes you really say some absurd things, don’t you? Hey, you! This is your fault, you know? Do something.”</p>

      <p>With that, Suimei turned to Graziella. She had a rather displeased look on her face, clearly unhappy that Suimei was speaking to her so heedless of her royal station.</p>

      <p>“You’re as insolent as ever, bastard. I am the princess of this nation, you know. Do you not have the grace to watch the way you speak around your social superiors?”</p>

      <p>“Do you really think I’d try and flatter someone who came here to pick a fight?”</p>

      <p>“Fair enough. Now that I think about it, just trying to imagine you speaking politely is actually sending shivers down my spine.”</p>

      <p>As Graziella flashed a provocative smile, a protruding vein became visible on Suimei’s forehead.</p>

      <p>“What’d you just say?”</p>

      <p>“Do it, Suimei-kun! Go for it!”</p>

      <p>As Suimei grew agitated, Lefille took advantage of the opportunity and tried to stoke the fire. There was no way any conversation was going to proceed now. Io Kuzami was laughing heartily, but everyone else just looked troubled. Eventually, no longer able to stand it, Reiji stepped in on everyone’s behalf.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Suimei, reel it in here.”</p>

      <p>“I’m not really...”</p>

      <p>“You too, Graziella-san. Okay?”</p>

      <p>Reiji looked at Graziella with a smile. He was likely trying to calm her in his own way, but there was no way that alone would appease her. It would never work...</p>

      <p>“Hmph... Very well. You’re right.”</p>

      <p>But contrary to all expectations, Graziella backed off. And with no argument. Suimei had been certain this stalemate would last for quite some time, so this unforeseen turn of events left his jaw on the floor. Everyone else felt the same way.</p>

      <p>“What? Every last one of you is making a strange face,” inquired Graziella.</p>

      <p>“Nothing. You just backed off rather easily...”</p>

      <p>“Is that bad?”</p>

      <p>“Not per se, but...”</p>

      <p>It was just hard to swallow. She had shown mercy to the tiny Lefille earlier, but at heart, Graziella was a sore loser. So for her to so simply back down against an opponent like Suimei with whom she had a standing feud, he was utterly staggered. The only thing he could figure was that it had been the intervention of the mediator, Reiji. And now that he thought about it, Graziella did look a little restless...</p>

      <p>“What’s this? Did that jerk Reiji capture another one?”</p>

      <p>“It appears so...” quietly replied Titania.</p>

      <p>“Hmph. Looks like it,” scoffed Io Kuzami.</p>

      <p>“Wait, wait, wait! Just when did that happen?” Suimei demanded in bewilderment.</p>

      <p>In a way, this was perfectly expected. It was the norm, after all. But Suimei was still floored. This was unknown to Suimei’s group, but after what had happened at the temple in the self-governed state, Graziella’s opinion of Reiji had become quite favorable. Titania was aware of this, and mumbled to herself in dissatisfaction about how Reiji just had to go and save her...</p>

      <p>“Anyway, I know it’s a little late to be asking this now, but why the hell are you here?”</p>

      <p>“What? Were you not informed?”</p>

      <p>“Come again...?”</p>

      <p>Graziella sounded as if she expected him to know what was going on, but Suimei had no clue. He’d only let her in because Titania had given him the okay. Why she’d even showed up in the first place was beyond him. Meanwhile, Reiji seemed to know what was going on and was feigning innocent.</p>

      <p>“Oh, did I not tell you?”</p>

      <p>“Hell no, you didn’t. I haven’t heard anything about this, so if you’ve got an explanation, you better get to it already.”</p>

      <p>“Suimei, Her Imperial Highness Graziella travelled with us to the self-governed state.”</p>

      <p>“The hell?”</p>

      <p>“It’s the fault of that annoying Goddess’s oracle,” said Graziella. “After you lot left the imperial capital, an oracle appeared before me to deliver the message that I was to accompany Reiji. That’s why I am here today as well.”</p>

      <p>Graziella went on to explain how she’d joined Reiji’s party. Which was why, more or less, she’d invited herself here. Listening to her, Suimei folded his arms atop his desk and groaned.</p>

      <p>“I get why you came, but isn’t it an entirely separate thing for you to be hanging out with us like this?”</p>

      <p>“The circumstances have changed. As long as I have my image to consider, I cannot insist on killing you. However reluctant I may be to relent.”</p>

      <p>“Well, I don’t really care as long as you know how to cool your jets.”</p>

      <p>With that, Suimei then turned to his companions.</p>

      <p>“Ah, I do not have any thoughts in particular on the matter,” said Felmenia, shaking her head.</p>

      <p>She bore no ill will for the princess. As long as her own princess had taken a stand on the matter, as her retainer, Felmenia was obliged to follow Titania’s lead rather than expressing her own opinion. Lefille, however, looked quite unhappy. If nothing else, her earlier exchange with Graziella made her reluctant to accept her now. But after she’d been so earnest, Lefille couldn’t outright object.</p>

      <p>“Then, starting all over, I am Graziella Filas Rieseld. I don’t expect you to treat me favorably, but do keep in mind that I am currently travelling with Reiji and the others.”</p>

      <p>After giving a short self-introduction, Graziella turned to Liliana.</p>

      <p>“Liliana Zandyke, it has been a while.”</p>

      <p>“It is good... to see you again.”</p>

      <p>“If you ever wish to return to the Elite Twelve, I’d be happy to hear your case anytime.”</p>

      <p>“Thank you... but I no longer have any intention... of returning.”</p>

      <p>“...I see. So be it, then.”</p>

      <p>As Liliana shook her head emphatically to make her refusal quite clear, Graziella readily backed off without hounding her. Her attitude made Suimei think that she was just playing the politics of pleasantries, but he caught the briefest glimpse of what looked like disappointment in her expression. It told him that, somewhere deep down, she really had wanted Liliana to return. It was understandable, considering her talents. Both her absence and Rogue’s must have been felt quite dearly by the Empire.</p>

      <p>“So, how much of our tale has already been shared?” asked Graziella.</p>

      <p>“Let’s see... We talked about Demon General Ilzarl, and we just finished up talking about Mizuki,” Reiji replied.</p>

      <p>“I see. Then it seems I made it in time to talk about that.”</p>

      <p>“‘That’?”</p>

      <p>Unsure what “that” was, Suimei cocked his head to the side.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, she means the reason we went to the self-governed state.”</p>

      <p>“Ah, that weapon or whatever some hero left behind, right?”</p>

      <p>“Mm. This.”</p>

      <p>It was there that Reiji pulled something out of his pocket. It was a silver accessory in the shape of a wing with a blue gem embedded at its center. It was something like a medal, but its construction was quite delicate. Seeing it, Lefille made a puzzled expression.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-kun, what is that accessory?”</p>

      <p>Her doubts were natural. Based on the flow of the conversation, everyone had expected him to present a weapon, not some piece of jewelry. Seeing it, Lefille wasn’t the only one who had her head cocked to the side.</p>

      <p>“Lefille-san, this is the weapon that was said to have been left behind by the hero.”</p>

      <p>“It is?”</p>

      <p>“Reiji-dono... It only looks like a mundane ornament to my eyes, but are you suggesting it is endowed with some sort of mystical power?”</p>

      <p>When Felmenia inquired about the true nature of the ornament, Reiji made a face like her question was a difficult one for him to answer.</p>

      <p>“It certainly seems to be, but...”</p>

      <p>While trying to explain things to Felmenia, Reiji looked down at the feathery ornament. He was surprised at what met his gaze, however—Suimei with a wrinkled brow was staring right back at him.</p>

      <p>“Suimei?”</p>

      <p>“This is a weapon, right? So why does it look like some regular old accessory?”</p>

      <p>“Well, you see... It transforms. Into a sword.”</p>

      <p>“No kidding...”</p>

      <p>With a slight sigh, Suimei stroked his chin and scrutinized the object in Reiji’s hand as he peered at it from different angles. Reiji then made a grim expression as he began explaining again.</p>

      <p>“When I first saw it, I also thought it was strange that it looks like an ordinary accessory. But this thing definitely transforms into a weapon. Though I don’t have any idea why it’s like this...”</p>

      <p>It was then Reiji realized that all eyes in the room were on him rather than the ornament. They were expectant, waiting for him to demonstrate.</p>

      <p>“Sorry, but I can’t turn it into a weapon.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean? If you know it turns into a weapon, that means you managed to do it previously, no?” asked Felmenia.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I did, but it seems there’s some sort of condition for the transformation. I was only able to do it that one time.”</p>

      <p>“White Flame-dono, the only time Reiji-sama was able to transform it into a weapon was in the heat of battle. The situation at the time was grim, but when Reiji-sama called out to it, it responded.”</p>

      <p>“When it transformed, I felt like I’d closed the gap between me and the demon general.”</p>

      <p>“Do you mean to say it made you stronger after it transformed into a weapon, Reiji-kun?”</p>

      <p>Something about that didn’t really resonate with Lefille, but the one to answer her doubts was someone who’d witnessed it herself—Graziella.</p>

      <p>“Just from what we saw, that weapon most likely strengthens the wielder and grants them abilities. He was manipulating a special power in addition to his own. It’s certainly fitting for a relic known as a hero’s weapon.”</p>

      <p>Graziella nodded repeatedly as she spoke of the weapon without a hint of facetiousness. Seeing Reiji wielding it must have left a rather strong impression on her.</p>

      <p>As for Suimei’s group, who hadn’t been there to see it in person, they were all only half convinced. It wasn’t that they didn’t believe their friends; it just didn’t seem real. But such skepticism was only natural. After all, seeing is believing—and all they could see right now was the mostly unremarkable pin-like accessory in Reiji’s hand. It just didn’t add up with what they were hearing.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono?” Felmenia suddenly asked, peering at Suimei.</p>

      <p>“I see, this is...” Suimei replied a beat late in a suspect tone.</p>

      <p>While everyone else was talking, he was simply staring at the relic. He seemed to be absorbed in thought rather than the conversation.</p>

      <p>“You may not believe us,” said Titania, “but everything we’ve said is the truth. After Reiji-sama turned it into a weapon, the demon general who’d driven me into a corner was easily overwhelmed...”</p>

      <p>A somewhat entranced expression on her face as she recounted the fight, she seemed to be recalling Reiji’s gallant figure in that moment. Suimei didn’t want to know what delusions were passing through her head, so he didn’t question her account. Reiji was also recollecting the encounter, however, and suddenly clapped his hands together when a certain thought crossed his mind.</p>

      <p>“Now that I think of it, I’ve never seen you use a sword like that, Tia. I had no idea you were so strong.”</p>

      <p>“No, it was nothing...”</p>

      <p>Titania naturally replied in a humble and ladylike manner, but...</p>

      <p>“Ergh...”</p>

      <p>What ended up coming out of her mouth was a befuddled gasp over her grave error. Suimei, who had been sworn to secrecy, was irrepressibly astonished to see her reveal herself so carelessly. As for the girl who’d let her secret slip, she was fidgeting anxiously and unable to form a proper sentence.</p>

      <p>“Ah, no, that was, that was, that was...”</p>

      <p>Reiji, on the other hand, raised a cheerful voice.</p>

      <p>“Gosh, you should’ve just told me from the get-go that you were so skilled with a blade. I’m practically an amateur. I would’ve loved to learn a thing or two from you.”</p>

      <p>Reiji was in no way criticizing her, but the way Titania fell completely speechless indicated she’d taken it that way. She had it in her head that “strong with a sword” meant “tomboy” meant “not good.” So having her secret exposed would be a serious affair indeed. Glancing at Titania, who was fidgeting endlessly, Graziella flashed a curious expression.</p>

      <p>“You were unaware that Her Royal Highness Titania was talented with a blade?”</p>

      <p>“What? You already knew, Graziella-san?”</p>

      <p>“But of course. Her Royal Highness is—”</p>

      <p>“AAAAAAAAH! No! You can’t, you mustn’t, you shan’t! I cannot have you say that, Your Imperial Highness!”</p>

      <p>Just as Graziella was about to reveal Titania’s secret identity, Titania exploded in a fit of energetic shouting. Graziella beheld her with a cold gaze.</p>

      <p>“I have no idea what reason you’d have to hide it, but after fighting in front of him, isn’t it far too late for that?”</p>

      <p>“B-But...”</p>

      <p>Having this pointed out to her, Titania faltered. She was still opposed to it because she didn’t want Reiji to dislike her. It was pitiful in its own way, but everyone in the room was watching her with expectant eyes, waiting for an answer. Seeing her so flustered and cornered was difficult for her retainer, and so Felmenia began explaining in her stead.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-dono, Her Royal Highness is one of the Seven Swords. The fourth, to be specific, who goes by the title Twilight Beheading Princess. Even here in the north, she is regarded as the pinnacle of swordsmanship.”</p>

      <p>You could practically hear the color drain from Titania’s face. At long last, she’d been found out. She looked as though she’d been plunged into the depths of despair, but Reiji’s reaction wasn’t she’d expected.</p>

      <p>“Wow, really? Tia, that’s amazing!”</p>

      <p>“Huh?”</p>

      <p>“Are you okay, Tia?”</p>

      <p>Titania looked so completely thrown off guard that Reiji was worried something was wrong. Finally becoming cognizant of a disparity between their expectations, both of them were blinking at each other in surprise.</p>

      <p>“U-Um, R-Reiji-sama, do you not think me a tomboy now?”</p>

      <p>“Why would I?”</p>

      <p>“W-Well, to go after an opponent with a sword is extremely unladylike... How should I say it? It seems boorish for a woman.”</p>

      <p>“Not at all. Especially since you’re so genteel and modest, Tia. I respect you for that.”</p>

      <p>“T-Truly?!”</p>

      <p>“Mm.”</p>

      <p>Reiji gave a quick nod, and Titania’s face instantly brightened. Meanwhile, the corners of Graziella’s lips curved upward in a twisted grin.</p>

      <p>“Your Royal Highness is far too naive. A man who would throw himself in harm’s way to protect others from evil would never look at a woman as an ornament for his own selfish conquest. Besides, if using a sword makes a woman a violent tomboy, then Shrine Maiden-dono here would be the absolute incarnation of boorishness, wouldn’t she?”</p>

      <p>“Don’t throw me in as a punchline each and every time!”</p>

      <p>When Graziella tossed a provoking glance Lefille’s way, she threw her hands up in the air and shouted in protest. Graziella had her by the nose.</p>

      <p>“I told you Reiji wouldn’t care about that kinda crap,” Suimei said with a mild shrug as he turned to Titania.</p>

      <p>“Huh? You knew too, Suimei?” asked Reiji.</p>

      <p>“Hmm? Ah, well, yeah. After she nearly beat me to death, she told me to keep my lips sealed.”</p>

      <p>“What? You fought Tia?”</p>

      <p>Reiji turned a critical and somewhat suspicious gaze on his friend, but it was the panicking Titania who replied.</p>

      <p>“I-It was nothing! That was, um... Suimei and I experienced a conflict of opinion... Or rather, there was a misunderstanding... There were various, um, various...”</p>

      <p>Titania had been the one to ask for the duel. She’d even raised her sword against Suimei without a good and proper reason to do so. It was understandable that she didn’t want Reiji to know that. But it seemed Reiji was under his own Reiji-esque misapprehension...</p>

      <p>“Aaah, you made Tia mad, didn’t you?”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Wait, what?! How am I suddenly the bad guy here?!”</p>

      <p>“I mean, that’s what happened with Sensei after we came to this world. Didn’t you do something again?”</p>

      <p>As Reiji looked at him skeptically, Suimei attempted to defend himself.</p>

      <p>“You really think I pissed off Tia?! That never happened!”</p>

      <p>“I can’t think of anything else... Go figure. You must have done something without realizing it. How about apologizing for it now and making nice?”</p>

      <p>“That was resolved a long time ago! And <em>I</em> was the one on the receiving end there... Hey, Tia, this is your fault! You know that, right? Tia?”</p>

      <p>“Heeheehee, not even a strong woman is too much for Reiji-sama... Now that I know that, there is nothing to be frightened of. Be it a demon or a rival in love, all I have to do is cut them down and finish them off...”</p>

      <p>Titania was muttering to herself in a low, sharp voice with a dark grin on her face. It was like she’d undergone a revelation—just an extreme and violent one. Suimei felt like he could see the dangerous aura building around her. Reiji simply watched her with a stiff smile.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what’s up with her, but she looks... super motivated, right?” said Suimei. “So can’t we let bygones be bygones?”</p>

      <p>“...Probably.”</p>

      <p>Suimei let out a big sigh and then urged a change of topic. Honestly speaking, he didn’t really care what it was at this point. His patience was tried. But in the midst of such discussion, an unexpected noise came from the ajar door to the living room. As everyone shifted their attention to the diminutive pitter-patter, they saw a lone cat walking in.</p>

      <p>“Meow.”</p>

      <p>It was like it was announcing itself. Did it want something? It didn’t appear to be urgent, but the resident cat expert—Liliana—was quick to translate.</p>

      <p>“It has a request... for Hero Reiji.”</p>

      <p>“Huh? Me?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. The cats seem to be hungry... and would like... to be fed now.”</p>

      <p>“So that why it’s here? Okay, sure. If that’s all, then I don’t really mind, but...”</p>

      <p>He couldn’t help wondering why it had to be him, but since he had no real reason to refuse, he nodded and agreed. His softhearted nature was getting the better of him, but even so, he was still a bit taken aback by the request.</p>

      <p>“Reiji-dono, I will take care of feeding the cats. Lily, is that alright?”</p>

      <p>“No, they want it to be Reiji... without fail. The cats... seem to be interested in him.”</p>

      <p>“In me?”</p>

      <p>“It’s likely related... to the divine protection you received... from the hero summoning. The cats are likely responding... to your sacred power.”</p>

      <p>Hearing Liliana’s theory, Reiji turned to the cat.</p>

      <p>“Really? You want it to be me?”</p>

      <p>“Meow!”</p>

      <p>Such an adorable answer caused Reiji to break out into a smile as he received the food from Liliana and headed outside. Short of hating them, there was no such thing as a person who didn’t delight in the affection of cats. Even Reiji looked quite happy as he was tending to them. Not long after he left the room, Liliana frowned.</p>

      <p>“Was that... too heavy-handed?”</p>

      <p>Graziella seemed to pick up on her meaning and raised a question.</p>

      <p>“As I thought, it was your intention to separate Reiji from us, wasn’t it?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. If Reiji is here... then there are things... that will be difficult to talk about. I was planning to have... Mizuki go with him, but...”</p>

      <p>At that, Liliana tossed a sidelong glance Io Kuzami’s way. The glint in her narrowed eye betrayed a hint of distrust. However, Io Kuzami acted like this didn’t concern her at all.</p>

      <p>“There is no need to worry about me. Indeed, you may just think of me as a divine sculpture whose beauty compels constant worship.”</p>

      <p>Ignoring everything else, her simile was a little out there. If it were true, she would just be a nuisance to have around. But despite having managed to make this about her beauty, it really just meant she intended to stay and listen. As Liliana looked to Suimei to confirm if this was alright, he nodded to her.</p>

      <p>“So, Lily, was that cat something you prepared?” Felmenia asked.</p>

      <p>“Yes. I got the cats... to cooperate with me. I should have told you... beforehand, shouldn’t I?”</p>

      <p>That was apparently what she’d been doing when everyone first gathered and she was off playing with the cats. As one would expect, she was still extremely cautious by nature.</p>

      <p>“Now... may I begin?”</p>

      <p>It seemed she’d gone to such lengths because she had something she wanted to discuss. As everyone’s attention fell on her, Liliana began speaking in her usual uneven manner.</p>

      <p>“This concerns the weapon... we were just talking about.”</p>

      <p>“Liliana, regarding that, did we not come to the conclusion it is simply something we do not know enough about?”</p>

      <p>They’d already discussed the relic. But when Titania pointed that out, Liliana shook her head and looked at Suimei.</p>

      <p>“Suimei, back when we were talking... about the weapon... your responses were quite vague.”</p>

      <p>“Hmm? That so?”</p>

      <p>“Yes. Suimei... do you know... about that weapon?”</p>

      <p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

      <p>“When we were discussing it... you seemed to be elsewhere. Also, when you see something you don’t understand... you make a very serious, inquisitive face. There was... practically none of that.”</p>

      <p>That was how she’d arrived at the conclusion that he knew something. Confronted with the evidence, Suimei put up both of his hands like he was surrendering.</p>

      <p>“That’s Liliana for you. Very perceptive.”</p>

      <p>“Though she is no longer, Liliana was still one of the Empire’s Elite Twelve. Such skills are to be expected.”</p>

      <p>“It’s a little different from what I’ve heard, but isn’t that the Sacrament?”</p>

      <p>When Suimei said that, Titania and Graziella’s expressions both froze. They had yet to mention the name of the weapon, so they were surprised to hear it come up. But they weren’t the only ones with questions.</p>

      <p>“Then you do know something about it, Suimei-dono?” asked Felmenia.</p>

      <p>“Well, more or less... But that’s it. The Sacrament is a weapon from my world. Magical heavy ordinance, to be specific.”</p>

      <p>In an unusual turn for Suimei, he prefaced his explanation with a lack of confidence. Surprised by what he revealed, however, Graziella responded first.</p>

      <p>“So as we thought, it originates from your world.”</p>

      <p>“As you thought?”</p>

      <p>“I am sure you already knew that the weapon is a relic left behind by a hero of old. But the name of another relic that was left behind with it uses a language from your world, leading us to believe that was where they’d come from.”</p>

      <p>“You don’t say...”</p>

      <p>Suimei wore a slightly curious expression, but Graziella continued.</p>

      <p>“So, what is it?”</p>

      <p>“There’s only but so much I can tell you. To put it simply, it uses mysteries that are different from magicka, and it’s an amazing weapon. Upon becoming its wielder, even a powerless nobody would be granted extraordinary power... Or so I’ve heard. But from the sounds of it, you guys got a glimpse of that already.”</p>

      <p>“Suimei-kun, I’m sorry to interrupt, but when you say ‘extraordinary,’ is that extraordinary by your standards?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm... Well, yeah. That’s how powerful it is. After all, the demon general that Tia and the imperial princess couldn’t lay a hand on was overwhelmed by the inexperienced Reiji with it, right?”</p>

      <p>“I see. Reiji-kun already has the divine blessing of the hero summoning. If he made another great leap beyond that, I can certainly understand what you’re saying.”</p>

      <p>After getting to know Suimei, Lefille had learned he had a bad habit of undervaluing himself. Moreover, he tended to speak of things relative to himself, which sometimes made for a skewed impression.</p>

      <p>“But Suimei, what is it exactly that makes the weapon so strong? No matter how you put it, its power seems to be most unusual.”</p>

      <p>“The Sacrament’s— No, it’s likely the outrageous part of the Lapis Judaicus set in it.”</p>

      <p>“Lapis Judaicus?”</p>

      <p>“You mean the gem?”</p>

      <p>Suimei nodded and began explaining in typical fashion.</p>

      <p>“There exists something called the Sage’s or Philosopher’s Stone. It’s an omnipotent catalyst that can turn lead or any other base metal into gold. Sometimes it’s just referred to as Lapis. In our world, creating Lapis is one of the goals of alchemy.”</p>

      <p>“Did you say...”</p>

      <p>“Gold?!”</p>

      <p>“Th-Then, Suimei-dono, do you mean to say such a stone is set in the Sacrament?! And by using it, one can create as much gold as they like?!”</p>

      <p>Upon hearing his conjecture, the color of Titania and Graziella’s eyes changed. Felmenia, as a mage, was naturally interested in learning what she could about such a confounding mystery, but the two royals of the group were likely processing the potential risks and rewards of being able to generate gold from mere junk. However, Suimei shook his head as he continued.</p>

      <p>“No, this is different from the Lapis created by alchemy.”</p>

      <p>“How so?”</p>

      <p>“Well, hear me out. According to mysticology, there are three varieties of stone given the name Lapis. They’re all related in a sense, and each of them is able to act as a catalyst to take a small amount of work and give birth to something far greater, hence why they’re each considered a kind of Lapis. The most valuable asset of alchemy, the Philosopher’s Stone, is called Lapis Philosophorum. The Holy Grail filled with a blue liquid that is said to be able to resurrect the dead and grant immortality to the living is called Lapis Lapsus ex Illis Stellis, or Lapis Exillis for short. And the third is what you saw.”</p>

      <p>“Lapis Judaicus...”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. The ancient story goes that an apostle grew arrogant and provoked the wrath of God, and was thus cast down to earth from the heavens. An emerald that repelled evil fell out of the crown the apostle was wearing at the time, which faded and turned blue. That’s said to be the origin of the Lapis Judaicus.”</p>

      <p>“In other words, it’s something created by a god of Suimei’s world...”</p>

      <p>“Not even close. That’s just a story. It’s not like it’s really something created by some grand god. I don’t know who first created it or where, but they are certainly outrageously powerful... Actually, there isn’t anyone left who knows how to make Lapis, so I can’t deny that the original might seriously have been created by a god.”</p>

      <p>After initially denying what Titania had suggested, he had to backtrack and admit that she might not be wrong. And it was then that Io Kuzami, who had been quiet up until now, suddenly spoke up.</p>

      <p>“My eternal rival, this isn’t like you. You’ve been giving nothing but half-cooked answers for some time now, have you not? Not a single conclusive thing has left your mouth.”</p>

      <p>“I’m an outsider when it comes to this stuff. Whether it’s the stone’s origin or purpose, there’s basically nothing that I know in full detail.”</p>

      <p>Suimei didn’t have the means to investigate the Sacrament or its Lapis Judaicus. Even in the archives at the Society’s headquarters, there were no documents which described it in detail. He didn’t know whether such information had been lost over the passage of time, or if it was just something that had been kept hidden. But either way, his knowledge on the subject was limited. Upon informing the others of this, Felmenia frowned dourly.</p>

      <p>“It’s something not even you know about, Suimei-dono...?”</p>

      <p>“I mean, it’s not like I know everything.”</p>

      <p>“But from what you’ve just said, bastard, you know of others that possess similar weapons?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, that’s certainly true, but... When they told me about it, I didn’t really get what they were saying.”</p>

      <p>“You didn’t really get it?”</p>

      <p>As Graziella’s expression grew more suspicious, Suimei reluctantly nodded. But Titania seemed to pick up on something in what he said.</p>

      <p>“Now that you mention it, Faylia-dono also said something similar. She said she received an explanation of the weapon from the hero, but she couldn’t truly understand it.”</p>

      <p>“Just as I thought...”</p>

      <p>Suimei had also been told about the Sacrament by its owner before. However, for some reason, most of what he’d heard barely seemed like words or even intelligible sound. To hear everything about the mysteries behind the Sacrament—in other words, to understand the concepts behind it—it seemed that there were certain special conditions that had to be met. Graziella then brought up another part of what Faylia had relayed to them.</p>

      <p>“If I remember correctly, the elf at the temple said that it was something made to forestall the end of the world.”</p>

      <p>“The end of the world?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. If you don’t believe me, ask anyone else—we were all there. Granted, this is assuming the elf remembered correctly.”</p>

      <p>Suimei looked over to Titania, who nodded in confirmation. She’d heard the same thing. But to think the Sacrament was made to forestall the end of the world... There was only one thing that came to mind for Suimei when he heard that.</p>

      <p>“In other words, it’s connected to twilight syndrome... It’s true I’ve heard about guys using one to beat down those beasts, but... they never mentioned anything about this...”</p>

      <p>When he’d heard about the Sacrament, its owner hadn’t mentioned the end of the world. Did that mean they didn’t know everything about it either? No, just what did...</p>

      <p>“Suimei, is there anything else that you know? For example, the method to turn the Sacrament into a weapon?” Titania asked.</p>

      <p>“I’ve heard about it. I mean, I heard the words to transform it into a weapon, but didn’t actually <em>hear</em> them.”</p>

      <p>“Is there anything needed other than the words?”</p>

      <p>“What the Sacrament needs is a grounded understanding of the mysteries behind it and strong purpose, or so it seems. The grounded understanding is required, but when the owner of a sacrament has a strong purpose, that is when it first manifests... No, when it is first able to become a weapon.”</p>

      <p>“A strong purpose... you say?”</p>

      <p>That didn’t seem to mean much to Titania. She twisted up her face and groaned a little. On the other hand, Io Kuzami seemed to have noticed something.</p>

      <p>“When it comes to strong purpose, there should be something that sticks out in your memories. When it happened, my fiancé was a tempest of powerful emotion. It is likely because of that that he was able to forcefully cause the Sacrament to transform.”</p>

      <p>Titania and Graziella both nodded, seemingly coming to an understanding upon hearing what Io Kuzami said.</p>

      <p>“If Reiji has the grounding to use the Sacrament, then isn’t it something he’ll eventually figure out one way or another? There’s no way for us to force anything if we don’t know the words,” said Suimei somewhat optimistically before moving on to his next question. “What was Reiji’s condition after the Sacrament turned back?”</p>

      <p>“There was not any particular change. Just as we said before, he only became stronger temporarily.”</p>

      <p>“So he was only stronger during the fight, huh...?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right. However, he was instantly exhausted when it was over.”</p>

      <p>The Sacrament was a weapon that ate mana. While in use, it was constantly consuming mana and vitality. According to the mysteries behind the Lapis Judaicus, the amount it consumed was designed to be small. Indeed, it was designed to make greatness from meagerness, but considering the scale of what the Sacrament was capable of accomplishing, the initial input was still considerably significant.</p>

      <p>Reiji had the divine blessing from the hero summoning going for him. It strengthened him, but even then, compared to a magician in possession of a mana furnace or a proper Sacrament wielder, it wasn’t enough. However, considering his growth and potential—how much magic power and stamina he’d already developed since coming to this world—he would likely be able to provide enough energy to the Sacrament eventually. That was Suimei’s thought, but somewhere along the line, he fell silent...</p>

      <p>“Is something the matter, Suimei-dono?”</p>

      <p>Felmenia noticed that he’d gotten quiet, but he didn’t respond right away. He kept to himself a few moments longer, and then, seemingly having arrived at a resolution, let out a resigned sigh.</p>

      <p>“No... I was just thinking it’s about time I need to tell Reiji.”</p>

      <p>“Oh? That’s...”</p>

      <p>“You mean about being a magician?”</p>

      <p>Even from Suimei’s vague answer, Lefille and Felmenia were able to guess what he meant. Titania was in the same position.</p>

      <p>“After all this time?” she asked with a composed expression.</p>

      <p>“What? Is that something you should be saying after the chaos you caused earlier?”</p>

      <p>“Just what are you talking about?”</p>

      <p>The tomboy swordswoman princess seemed to be intent on pretending it had never happened. As Suimei looked at her playing dumb with a bitter face, Graziella—the only one in the room who didn’t know the circumstances—spoke up.</p>

      <p>“Why have you not told him before now?”</p>

      <p>“I was taught from day one to keep that quiet. So you could say the reason I didn’t speak up even after coming to this world is a carryover of that.”</p>

      <p>“But in this world, he’d end up finding out eventually, wouldn’t he? Especially considering you’re investigating magic to return home. In the end, you’d have to reveal your secret in order to get back.”</p>

      <p>“No, I could’ve just kept it hidden and half-assed an excuse for the completed magicka circle. And once we got home, the details would be up to them to puzzle out. As long as they didn’t have any regrets about leaving this place, who knows? It might never have even come up again.”</p>

      <p>“I see.”</p>

      <p>Suimei wanted to give them a way out. He, Reiji, and Mizuki had been summoned to this world against their will. But now that Reiji had taken up the Demon Lord’s subjugation, there was no way Suimei or anyone else would be able to convince him to just up and go home. But if Suimei could come up with a way for them to come and go, he would be able to make that decision without fear of regret since he could always come back. Titania didn’t much seem to like Suimei mentioning returning to their world, and turned a somewhat sharp gaze on him.</p>

      <p>“So then, Suimei, why did you have a change of heart now after all this time?”</p>

      <p>“That thing.”</p>

      <p>“That thing? You mean the Sacrament?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah. If he’s taken up that thing, there’s no going back. Even once we make it home to our world, that won’t be the end of it. There’s a 100 percent guarantee he’ll end up getting caught up in something else. And if the Society is going to look after him, then my identity will ultimately be revealed anyways.”</p>

      <p>Even if they managed to safely return home, considering Reiji’s personality, he would inevitably get caught up in the mysteries of their world. Once a person who can’t silently stand by the misfortune of others gained mystical powers, it was natural that they would begin sticking their head into all sorts of affairs. The others seemed to understand that, and all silently came to an agreement.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-dono, will you tell him right away?”</p>

      <p>“Hmm, no, I’ll take it step by step... Probably.”</p>

      <p>Smiling like he was trying to dodge the real question, Lefille looked at him suspiciously.</p>

      <p>“Suimei-kun, you’re a good-for-nothing.”</p>

      <p>“Sh-Shut up, Lefille-san! Cut me some slack, will ya?!”</p>

      <p>“Suimei... is such a coward... at the weirdest times.”</p>

      <p>Suimei was unable to respond to Liliana’s words. It was Graziella who took a crack at him next.</p>

      <p>“I don’t really give a damn about you either way, but are you not worried your friendship with Reiji and Mizuki will suffer for this?”</p>

      <p>“Yeah, Mizuki’ll be pretty pissed for a while, but if I honestly open up to him, Reiji will... Well, he’ll probably sympathize with me. He’s not that narrow-minded a guy. It’s true that there are some things that are hard to say after all this time, but...”</p>

      <p>Suimei frowned as he put his hesitation into words. Rather than guilt weighing on him for not telling them, it was worry for what might befall them after they came to find out. All magicians accepted that magicka needed to be kept secret from the general public to prevent normal people from getting too deeply involved with mystical affairs. Humans were naturally attracted to the mysterious. Once their eyes were opened to the other side, it became easier for them to see things that ordinary people didn’t. And easier for them to get sucked into the trouble that surrounded such things.</p>

      <p>That was why, before coming to this world, Suimei had never planned on telling his best friends. It was why he’d hesitated to even after coming here. However, he couldn’t deny that he was ultimately pigeonholing them. Suimei knew that Reiji would be understanding if he told him. That he wouldn’t get mad. That it wouldn’t ruin their friendship. But it would put him in danger, and that was what worried Suimei the most.</p>

      <p>“Good grief... So it’s come to this in the end, huh?” he said with a heavy sigh.</p>

      <p>Soon after, Reiji came back inside in spirits that had been lifted high by the healing power of cats.</p>
